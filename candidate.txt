I sell them.
See, I'm new.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
How are you?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Whatta you mean? Me?
Well, no... not just, not only.
I just wanted to make sure.
It's a mistake to think that.
We keep going.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Pinned? What does that mean?
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
--not fair?
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
Who paid the bill?
Uh-huh.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
I don't think you're so bad.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
What was it then?
We just have to make a new beginning.
You know each other?
I cut myself.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
You want to kill him?
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
No.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
I wanted it
I would say you're very shy by nature.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
I know.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
And we didnít want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneyís worth.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
We can look into that.
Is that what you think?
Yeah, it is...
He's not breathing, Mom.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
I'll be right back, baby, really.
You're right -- I am a coward.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
It was substantial.
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Okay.
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Baby, don't do this --
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
...very good.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Elaine, what's going on?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yeah?
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
I don't know.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
How can you tell that -- from here?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Who else?
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Why?
That ain't much of a name.
Two meters.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Of course.
What did she say?
What...?
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Yes, I reckon that's it.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
We've got to get Cathy.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
No, but it was here.
See you later.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
It's all yours.
Well, it's enough for me.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
No.  What's that?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
I need a shower.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Surprised?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
We should stop seeing each other.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
I'm here.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
And why do you say that?
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Ow.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
How'd you get up here?
You bit my finger.
What's your being married got to do with it?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Thanks.
No.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
Did you call the police?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Where's the rest of it?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
What?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Looks like it, yeah.
<i>Are you all right?</i>
What a shame.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Never been to Maine before?
I see that.
You can't be in here.
Do you?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Aw, Baby.
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Do it my way.
So?
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I've got problems.
You crazy? Hit him with what?
What am I scared of?
Stop talking...
Just dinner.
Well yeah...I know that.
Yes.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
What's the...OH SHIT!
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
I don't gamble.
I'm sorry.
And I love what you're wearin'.
Do you think they have a room here?
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
It might have.
What?
It's succeeding!
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
You can't prove anything.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Is it cold?
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
O.K.
Can I have some?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
I'm through improvising.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
What're you talking about --
My wife.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
I said NO!
Oh, let it ring.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What happened after you smelled it?
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Uh-huh.
I have something even better.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Yeah?
-- just wonderful.
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Erin --
Yeah.
I'm not, no.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
I haven't. No.
Have *you*?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I said I'm a dying man!
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
No.
I need... to talk to you.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
...Then go.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
They just don't want us going in there.
We did the decent thing.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
You saved me.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
'Remembrance'.
With the same friend?
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
But I am...
Two years.
No mam -- I looked all over.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I'll come early tomorrow.
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Well, thank you.
Nothing.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I put her to bed.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
My mind's not on guessing games.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Still my beautiful child.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Humor me, Sid.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Violet, please!
But you didn't.  Why not?
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
You get that off the screen?
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Why not?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
What happened?
You interested in a little work?
How do you know Annie?
What?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Is that Jango?
That it's about to go wrong.
I should have known.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Not dollars. Pounds.
Define your terms.
Well, I do.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Rachel's job is she works.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Don't get kinky here...
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
What?
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Are you busy on Friday?
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Give me an example.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
I dunno, I...
Not yet.
Fifth of scotch?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
I'm doing it.
What kind of "stuff?"
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
You've only had sex with three different people?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
I said I'm a dying man!
Would it?
You sure?
Why didn't you tell me?
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
No.
That's enough, Ellen.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Ok.
No, uh...
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
What?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
I am.  You-you made my day.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
Don't be funny.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
I wanted you to.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I need you on my side.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Why not tell me now?
Thank you, Rose.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Nah...
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Really?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
What?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
You sure it wasn't me?
I loved it.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
I didn't finish talking to you!
That's what I am.
Never better. You sleep well.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes no not really.
I know.
--do as I say!
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Yes.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Besides, I've got to stay here.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
How many?
To our family.
The bay doesn't.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Um. You're doing all right.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
I wasn't finished.
I thought maybeóuhó"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
I think -- she's crazy.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Let's dig in!
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
And you think it's best if I don't come.
...namely a personality.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I know the feeling.
You've had a better offer, eh?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
They must have turned him down.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
I don't know
Sure.
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Jen please ...
Around.
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
I have lava.
Nobody.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
How did you know?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
My name is Travis.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
This is Miss Marsh.
Well, just one.
I'm on at nine.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
But what has to be different?
There're no cars on this street.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
I must go to England -- at once.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Why not?!
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Good point.
That's the key question.
Why?
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
... and Karen.
Good.
Hm?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
You're not interested in him?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
But I love you.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
No rawness.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
I shall return.
I swear.
My name's Leonard.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
How goes it, darlin'?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
That's it?
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
No!
Amy...
Don't make it less true.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
The engine is still running.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Just dinner.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Why?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Whatever you say.
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Why not?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I am on the track of...
What crap?
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
I can sit through it once.
I will.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
Fine.
Four days.  I left to think.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Yeah I'm fine.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
I...
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Who would find out?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Shhh!
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
I don't like dancing.
But this is different.  Go on blow,
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Probably not.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Really?
I don't know! I just did!
Yeah.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Of course.
Thanks, I needed that.
That was in Vietnam.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Lois, I . . .
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Not very well.
You're not missing much.
I didn't know that.
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
Where did you mail them?
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
Okay.
What?
They just finished supper.
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Where's my watch? It's gone.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Doesn't say.
Want company?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Very well.
Come on, let's go.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Great.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
Hector thinks you like him.
Do I look crazy?
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
I refuse.
Absolutely positive.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
You really want that on your head?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Not you my dear.
What's going on, Claire?
Me more than most.
I'm Father Karras.
I want to buy a car.
Point taken.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
What friends?
Oh I been out.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
I'm going to Amarillo.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Because it was on the show!
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
What about... now?
I love you -- remember?
I was.
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Is he working?
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Okay, okay.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Alice?
What do you mean?
Why not?
I write about it?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Agatha...
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
We'd break some furniture.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Told you not to call your mama.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
You really want to know?
A bride without a head!
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
And what makes you so tough?
The Telegraph office.
Paved with what, then?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I'm not either!!
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
'Love will find out the way'?
What?
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
No, thanks.
No, why?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
I will do my best.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Yes.
What for?
You hate that.
It did.
Hello.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
It's been a while since...
He was at the campground yesterday.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
What... what do you mean?
Are you scared?
That was unfortunate.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Yes, I did.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
Who is it?
To Paris. Paris, France.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Not because you were attracted to him?
What do you want?
I guess.
Ah!
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Sounds like a special guy.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Another satisfied client's wife.
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Great.
You talked to his wife?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Got a nice evening dress?
What?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Why?
Uh-huh.
And you think it's worth all this?
Well, that all depends.
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
Happy. He said "happy?"
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
HURRY.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
You should.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
Yeah. So why you look do down?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
What? What do you mean?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
I know.  I'm glad.
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
She got those shoes...
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
What? Another letter from your friend?
WHAT!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Of course.  How much?
Some people prefer it.
That's right. You didn't.
Excited.
What's his line?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
I just forgot.
Yes, I do.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Such as?...
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
I was dreaming again?
Are you crazy?
The stuff we got last night.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Funny shit, man.
Oh - you're an actress.
Nah, I got me a job.
I'm glad you like it.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Then you will please wait outside.
Really want to know?
I don't know.
Why not?
Ice?
Nope.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Very cool. Trippy.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
Can you see a body?
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
I will find you. I will be with you.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
Refreshing.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
Of course. Where else?
Emily, you -
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Would Walter really press charges?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Right. April 25th.
Forget it.
How does it?
Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
What?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Here is now there. There is here.
I mean I appreciate that.
Super...man. Hmmm...
Can I walk you home?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereís something not quite right.
Except for Small Eyes.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
No, no, it's different.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Yes.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Behind you.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Will that help?
Bracelets.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Hide the car.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Why?
Busy?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
I don't know.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Why should I help that old fuck.
No. Is that what you want?
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
-- Love story of our time.
Why?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
How is the garden doing?
You must have been a baby.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Walk away.
But Lana, you could --
Yes I am.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
That's no way to talk...
No.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Might be different in New York.
Calm down, baby.
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
You don't say?
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
Get on. I'll take you to him.
I'll find her.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
They're nothing like us.
Go to the prom with me
Ah, history I think.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"
I know that. But I'm --
Frost?
I can be very persuasive.
Is she a Capulet?
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
But a hundred men could move him.
Yeah.  I know.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
What are you doing?
All right, look--
Go right over there.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Why were you scared?
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Good.  How are you?
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
You don't have to hunt to do it.
I'm a little dizzy...
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Yeah. Thanks.
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
What was that?
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
I left three messages already.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
About the baby.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
You think I can't learn that?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Not very likely.
And this is your "work"?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Bodybuilding!
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
That's good... who?
We were?
You're not far wrong.
The place is pretty dusty.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
I'm sorry.
Well, you didn't marry her.
School?
Now take your panties off.
Good.
What?
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Another 'you'?
You talk as if I were Asta.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You want to take a walk with me?
It's not that easy.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Where do you get these questions?
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
I'm not going to quit now....
The human condition.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
I've got to take a piss.
No, not at all.
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
You can make a mistake.
Because it's not.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Oh, no.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
On one condition...
I need a shower.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
I can't!
I think so.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
They know you are Tutsi!
How you let men treat ya like they do?
Again? Good idea.
You too.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Mrs. Christian.
No.
Thank you. But I think Iíll go to bed. Itís been a long day.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Well, it was a silly question.
I don't think I could really describe it.
Thatís a big one for me, too.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Oh--yeah--
You mean...and orgasm?
Please! Norville!
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
I can try.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Not at all.
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Anything, Ninotchka.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How d'you know what I'm like?
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Did you?
It will grow back again!
And I never will -- you know what's between us -ó we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
What?
I don't think so.
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Oh, this is wonderful...
Something like that.
Travel...and things.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Listenó get this straightó don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Then we'll be right where we are now.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Really?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Thanks.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
At least you were outside.
Yes.
What about her?
Eating is eating... and...
I'm just kidding.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Answer the phone.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Yeah.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
...have to wait.
... All right.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
The gas tank's going to go any second!
I've been doing good, though.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Never.
And...?
Yeah, maybe.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
They have, sugar.
Yes.
What?
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Those checks take forever.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Always.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I'm thirty-four.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Are you a 5 or a 6?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Iím a talking head.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
No more drugs.  Please...
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Let me take another look at that ring.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Finished or unfinished?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Another distraction.  It's not right.
What else is new? Right?
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
N-no...
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Christ, sure... yes!
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gimme a break.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
With Hypnocyl?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
He'd assume we had.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Very nice.
Yeah.
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Awake? What do you mean?
We love our lives just the way they are.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Hi there.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I'm fine.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Byrd's dead.
Ken.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
I didn't mean police.
You heard.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Yeah. Come onówe're stopping here for the night.
Not nobody, not nohow!
Just take deep breaths.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
What would you have me believe?
Because thatís where I live.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Carnations.
Mmm, I could tell.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
One baked -- one fries.
No, no.
You're not going anywhere.
Eight stories.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Judy --
I can't wait for you to meet her!
I should probably write that down.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
Yes...
My whole life has been combat.
That's what I'm having.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Where? In the leg?
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
And now?
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Groovy.
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Are you in trouble with the law?
You're going to listen to me.
Francesca?
...Then go.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
You better not sing that song.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
You're looking for a bomb.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Let us out!
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Elena.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
I think it's time I came home now.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Sleep well.
Oh, Vada...
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Sam?
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
I don't know what happened.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Rae...
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
And you're sure about that?
You already have.
Ma'am.
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Casharoonie!
You are.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
I can't resist.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
All this. All of it.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
You're telling me.
You got a brew?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Nobody does that single-o.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
I missed you, Fran.
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Like what?
We're going up the tower.
I was a musician.
What was your deal with Job?
I'm having one now.
Doesn't say.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well...
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
And this Jeremy--
I'm a very sick girl.
Well, thanks, I --
But --
You attacked me.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
In every sense. If at all possible.
I think you liked it with him.
What was your major?
How is Central these days?
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
I was attacked.
How did you know that?
Cartwright.
I told her. I sounded off.
That's a fine-looking ring.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
We have to talk.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Does she?
Beauty and fragrances.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
Yeah, sure. Of course.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Why are you doing this?
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
This way!
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
We have to stick with the plan.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Does he know that?
Us.
Those are pretty hostile words.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
No -
Go!
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
You think he might be missing?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Little boy?!  That's him!
Okay.
Terribly sorry.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Good for you.
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
I think not.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
I'm still here.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Very much.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
How often does this happen?
You don't?
Hey, I got an idea.
Yeah.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
I'm not a stalker.
I can't. Go away from me.
How was your date?
You're too quick for me.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Roger.
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
Lead the way.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
Yeah. Good.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
What is it, a still life?
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
It's no big deal.
Did you?
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Abby--
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
We'd better talk.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
But you copy my work every week.
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
What picture?
You know about Adele.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
The pleasure is mine, madame.
The hell we can't.
Hey.
Shan't happen again.
-- Permanently?
She is beautiful.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Huh? Yah?
Even the swallows are back.
How many times a year.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Home is where the heart is.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
My darling.
By the hour of nine.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Daddy's dead.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Oh.  FIne.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Hmmm?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
On a plane back to Sicily.
Beg pardon?
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
More or less.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
<u>You</u> left me.
Yeah, it was awful.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Hi. It's Nathan.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Robin, listen to me.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
What're you talking about --
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
I...
Soon honey, soon.
Don't tell him you're here.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Shh!
...Stanley Moss...
Well we gotta do something!
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
All? It ain't bad.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Why not?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Yes.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
Why are you doing this?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
I don't want his money.
--my number one fan.
I might not stay, anyway.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Yes.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
So's the video camera.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Come on.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
I said... STOP!
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
That's okay.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I know.  Get out here.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
To fetch your napkin.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Look, if you want to leave...
On one condition...
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
There wasn't time?
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
I believe in you.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Take off your God damn coat!
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
Who were you with?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Tonic will be fine.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
We haven't checked.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Lower.
Very well put.
I saw one.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
What is it, Rose?
Next time, date only basketball players.
What?... What'd you do?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
It doesn't look like it.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
Hi Vada, can you come out?
No.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
LET'S DO IT!
Order me a pastrami for after?
Sweetheart, what day is today?
I only protect myself -- !
You're right.
What?
Why not? It was just money.
Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
Is that Nietzsche?
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
He didn't ask me to...
Frances, I'm warning you...
You know what we ought to do tonight?
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
Where, then?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Where is the lamp?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
What happened to him?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Oh aye, a sledge.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Then you're not a pro.
I don't know who that is.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Well...
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Fine.
You getting cold feet?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
How'd they get it inside?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
Of what?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
We won't be here.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
I did.
Really?  What did White say?
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
-- we can't now.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
I believe in you.
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
Forget it.
Good.
It don't look right.
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Good girrrl!
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
I'm not following you --
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Uh huh.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Why did you quit?
But it went away...We would have known....
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Mm-hm.
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
You like her?
Ashamed.
You do?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Yeah, I know all that.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
Coming here?
Truce.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
That bad, eh?
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
Want to take it back?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Only way to be.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
Yeah. Call him.
What about Cortina?
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Well what?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
...Were you?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Just wait there for me!
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
I know that...
I'm just temporarily off my game.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Fine... fine.
You love him, don't you?
Because it's illegal.
Stand back.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
You betcha.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
I doubt that.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
The other side....
Why do you think?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
His name?
What?
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
So how's Tommy?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Was he a law student at the time?
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
How low?
I knew it.
I don't know...
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
They don't scare me any more.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
I think I should.  3000W?
Itís an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Iím gonna buy it...
You got worms.
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
I'll take care of it.
How would you know?
Oh, sorry.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute.  Youíre my wife?
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
Yeah, you don't remember?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
No, I...
He was nervous.
How?!
Didn't you know he made things?
You think they're strange?
Someone waiting for you?
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
It'll just be a few days.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Why not?
What?!
The audition.
I'll explain on the way.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I'm very sorry.
Hi.
Why?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
I'd love it!
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Keep stroking it!
And you didn't come up here to see her.
You must hate it.
Get out of here!
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
It was at least as good as the sky.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I cry at the opera.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
I hate public transport.
How come?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Let it ring.
I already did.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
But Elaine --
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Is there one in these waters?
So?
I have something for you...
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Do you fear them?
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate!
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Why?
Used to. Not anymore.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Yes.  My best friend.
Yes no not really.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Where are you?
Sister older or younger?
Holly.
Coming.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Really?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
For their meat.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
You're possessive.
Good...Well...Take care.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
How prominent?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
What's that?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Yes.
It's a long way to go for a date.
You're entitled.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Where to?
That's not crazy. I like you too.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Enough!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
I'm freezing.
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
You don't have a boyfriend?
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
I dunno.  Just being weird.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Mid-town mostly.
I don't like dancing.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
I hear the dog really liked him.
What time is it?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
In what man!
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Didn't I say that?
I have to.  Iím the best man.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love óó Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Please.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Looks like rain, Steed...
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Why would you lose me?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Yes, ma'am.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Yes, dear.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Three weeks.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Nothing -- only to be here.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
OK.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Want to take a walk?
Alice?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
I won't.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
I know the feeling...
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Great.
It was Henry Follett.
It was only a mouthful!
I hesitated taking that much.
What happened to the donut king?
What bag?
Count to twenty.  Iíll be there.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Cause she's dead.
You don't have to--
Where is she?
Of course.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
You don't look like a college girl.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Vampires of the world, beware.
She saw through me.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Madeleine!!
Why's that?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
No!  They're still on their way.
I don't know! I just did!
You look so different.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
I'll be right over.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Hello.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Let's go talk to Bill...
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
Can't he come out for one day?
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
What are you doing here?
When's school over?
How come you don't stay with them?
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
No.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
I like.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Really?  What did White say?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Oh, yes you are.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
Siam.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
But why, Claudia?... Why?
What's the apartment house number?
Yes, Swana.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I just want you to like me.
Beats king up.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yes, I am, Norma.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
We definitely want it to have junk.
What for?
What a pleasant hobby.
What the hell you need her for?
Get in.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
O.K.
Oh, this is wonderful...
Okay.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
What are you talking about?
Five years. My son was born here.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I'm going to bed now.
Do you remember me getting sick?
I'm fine....
Yes, Comrade?
This morning.
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Yeah -- but can she cook?
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Okay.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
Adele for god sake please lis...
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
I don't know.
Hey, that's super
Yup.
Yes.
How come?
Yeah?
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
I thought maybeóuhó"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
RUN, DAMMIT!!
I never said I was.
I can't dance fast.
Here is now there. There is here.
I guess I owe you my life.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Dress, huh?  What for?
More than you need me.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
No --
What?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
And you gonna live it with him?
What did Jennifer have?
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I'm sorry.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
Extremely clever.
What's the matter?
Yeah.
Annie, what's the matter?
Violet, I won't let you leave.
I've offended you!
Uh...
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Please - - chance it.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Hm.
What? No you're not..
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
You got us a room so quick?
And who's Claude?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Oooh.
Why?
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
So where would we go?
Yeah.  Drowning.
What about the game?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Wait a minute!
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
