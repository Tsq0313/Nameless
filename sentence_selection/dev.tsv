What a man!	Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?	0
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!	In what man!	0
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.	My name is John Ferguson.	0
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?	There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.	0
These are all from me.	This one says, "To Mother from Amy."	0
Uh oh --	Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?	0
Then call me tomorrow.	Today is tomorrow.	0
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob ó Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.	0
You... you couldn't have heard me.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.	0
I love you, Wally.	What?	0
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?	No.	0
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?	So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...	0
What about you?	Don't worry about me, just go.	0
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--	0
Did I do good?	You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.	0
Hello, Mr. M.	Hello, Tracy.	0
You need a COAT!	Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.	0
What?	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.	0
No one does nothing, Jeff.	Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.	0
I mean yes, I help people that need it...	I think it looks good.	0
Yes.	But that's all behind us now.	0
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --	Finding out where she is.	0
Well, what about artificial insemination?	Where was this?	0
I figured he had a right to know.	And?	0
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...	Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.	0
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.	That's right!	0
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...	What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...	0
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?	What's your real name?	0
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.	Who is it?	0
Ergo?	You wouldn't believe me.	0
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.	What's that stand for?	0
That's a silly joke.	They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.	0
So, what causes this?	No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...	0
Bastard, sneak, quitter.	Speaking.	0
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--	What's she talking about?	0
I remember, distinctly, being fired.	That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!	0
Yes.	It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!	0
No thanks... .	Hit me again, Mac.	0
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.	0
Let's eat our cake.	I know.	0
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.	Don't overestimate yourself.	0
Danny, come here!	Mommy... Mommy...!	0
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?	Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?	0
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.	Hey, I'm, you know --	0
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.	But then I won't be able to see anything.	0
She called you, didn't she?	Oh?	0
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.	Absolutely.	0
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?	I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.	0
God, I've missed you.	Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.	0
Yes.	out again?	0
The girl I remind you of.	She was the Queen of the Netherlands.	0
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.	On the nose.  I tell you what, because youíre so cute, Iíll take care of our incidentals.	0
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.	Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.	0
You didn't think much about that before.	Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.	0
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.	That's why I wear a target on my chest.	0
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...	You in a hurry?	0
Very.	I won't be needing these anymore.	0
Here we go.	Great.	0
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.	I'd been told as much.	0
There's always an excuse, isn't there?	I think it's time I came home now.	0
What are you doing, Ted?	I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!	0
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.	I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?	0
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....	Let me heal you, baby.	0
So this is it, right?	Oh.  No.	0
Which ones?  I bring them all.	Luminal.	0
Here.	Don't DO that!!	0
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.	Are you okay?	0
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...	And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.	0
I thought you'd be up with the sun.	My stupid back.	0
Alex, what is it?	Holding you... again.	0
Where are you going?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.	0
Where will he go?	Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.	0
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.	Have you been there?	0
Wanna walk me home?	Sure.	0
Dysfunctional --	Thank you.	0
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.	I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.	0
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?	0
You don't know me.	Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?	0
Are you hungry?	Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --	0
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.	I get that impression.	0
Who are you people?	I know what junk is.	0
You followed me.	Orders.	0
Ordell pick up his bond?	Same as you. Ten thousand.	0
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.	No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.	0
So who -- what -- are you?	This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?	0
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.	Why?	0
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.	The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.	0
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...	Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...	0
What's the problem?	In every way.	0
Can I call you?	Off me or off you?	0
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --	Jesus.	0
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.	Okay.	0
Well, I think I've had enough.	What time is it?	0
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.	I was married to her sister ..	0
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.	Her show?	0
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.	No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.	0
You're leaving?	I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.	0
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.	Okay. All right.  And what do I say?	0
Why are we leaving?	Are you always sucha good judge of character?	0
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.	Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?	0
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.	Where are you gonna go?	0
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?	Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?	0
Yes, what?	Don't answer me. Say what I say.	0
No.  Did he really?	But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.	0
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.	I'll second that.	0
Did you write that column?	...gger.	0
No?	It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.	0
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?	I don't have one.	0
How nice.	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?	0
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?	Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!	0
No children?	If that's true, they're a dying race.	0
Don't look so scared.	Really.	0
What do you suppose this was...?	Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.	0
It's my day off.	... He ought to put him in here.	0
I'm afraid I'll faint.	Whatever you do, don't do that.	0
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.	Who?	0
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !	0
But it's not funny now.	I'd like to know.  I'll go along.	0
Up.	And leave me down here???	0
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?	Kaminski.	0
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.	0
Blow it up?	Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.	0
First time in a grav couch?	Yes.	0
My father wouldn't approve of that that	Where's the one you're building?	0
Why?	Hello, Tracy.	0
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.	You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels ññ the oldest champagne ññ the richest caviar ññ the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!	0
Not at all.  It was fascinating.	Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?	0
We do not go into your courts.	People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.	0
You sound like an artist.	No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.	0
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.	Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.	0
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?	You're out of your mind!	0
Then what? My boobs are too big?	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?	0
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.	It's just a city park.	0
--And he has sex appeal.	So what?	0
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?	Yes.	0
Are we safe?	Maybe...	0
Dorsia's nice.	More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.	0
Yes!	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.	0
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..	I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.	0
Is Vanessa here?	Nope. We're safe.	0
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?	Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.	0
I found one.	Alive?	0
Walter, you can't do that!	Just think about it.	0
No. I'm not.	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.	0
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -	Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?	0
Buddy, you're just a child.	Why? What has happened?	0
Virginia?!	Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .	0
Nervous?	No kidding.	0
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?	"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.	0
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.	I'll try.	0
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.	The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.	0
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.	0
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?	0
I'm so burnt-out.	Oh, how did you get burnt-out?	0
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?	What?	0
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?	0
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?	You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.	0
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.	Why do you say that?	0
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge.	0
It sounded like a pick-up line.	I can't pick you up.	0
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.	Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?	0
I remember you were in trouble all the time.	Why not? Please - it would help me	0
Try sitting down.	I did--and--and I got right up.	0
What girl?	The young girl. Who pulled her?	0
Where the hell were you?	I'll meet you there.	0
That's a picture of me in Japan.	No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...	0
You will.	It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.	0
Not a pressing issue.	I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?	0
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.	That's right.	0
It's getting quiet.	Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...	0
About forever.	The other reason?	0
That's a very personal question.	It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.	0
Across the board, sir.	And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.	0
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?	What did he mean by Huxley?	0
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.	Cool.	0
That's enough.	So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.	0
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.	You're saying no.	0
Want a blow job?	I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...	0
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.	I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...	0
I don't think this is any time to be funny...	He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."	0
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?	Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.	0
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.	Maybe an animal.	0
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!	Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?	0
I must go. I'm in a hurry.	I want to talk to you later.	0
I still have your virginity!	Awwwww!	0
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--	I was the Warden?	0
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.	Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.	0
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.	I'll try.	0
Did you get him?	I don't know.  Back the truck--	0
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.	He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.	0
I'm coming with you.	How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.	0
They just want you to hire some new help.	Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."	0
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.	C'mon. Let's go.	0
What is it?	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.	0
One, two, three...	No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?	0
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...	I don't know.	0
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.	No.  Stick around.	0
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?	Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--	0
Ray?... What time is it?	I don't know. It's early... I love you.	0
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...	An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?	0
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.	It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.	0
Is this a bad time?	Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?	0
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?	0
-- no, it'll help me, really --	It was not butchery.	0
Walter can I ask you something?	What!	0
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.	Yeah.	0
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.	John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.	0
I can't.	Yes, I stand for -	0
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.	Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.	0
Where?	Lint?	0
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.	It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.	0
Hey, Mike?	What? Are you all right?	0
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.	Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.	0
I can't....	Good night, Sugar.	0
David! Where on earth have you been!?!	And I intend to be there when she's ready.	0
What?	You look beautiful like that.	0
What do you do with all this pudding?	That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.	0
Hi. Nice to see you.	She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.	0
the valley?	Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.	0
Did I say jerk?	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?	0
I mix what I like.	Okay. Mix.	0
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.	yeah?	0
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...	I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.	0
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!	Yeah, like what?	0
She's flying starships !	Who ?	0
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.	I'll try.	0
That's the idea.	What?	0
Oui, doctor, oui.	Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?	0
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.	Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.	0
Landon --	It was the only thing I've ever asked him!	0
What about Janet?	That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.	0
Brad...	It's alright Janet.	0
But he's a policeman --	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?	0
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --	Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.	0
I understand.	Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.	0
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.	A literary feud. Quite normal.	0
Roseman Bridge?	With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.	0
What?	Because --	0
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?	I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.	0
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.	*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!	0
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?	But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...	0
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.	You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.	0
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.	I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.	0
Jake'll take care of me.	Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?	0
Well, time will tell, won't it?	Yes, darlin', time will tell.	0
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --	Oh, this is Andy --	0
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.	You're far crueler than I, my sweet.	0
I suppose so.	Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.	0
Do you think weíd let him get away with the murder of my brother?	We? You and your parents killed your husband?	0
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.	Okay.	0
You're kidding! Like what?	Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.	0
Oh-oh! TouchÈ, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Donít. You might get confused speaking of things you donít understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youíve done what we are paying you for.	Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.	0
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.	Bye.	0
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.	John Doe Clubs? What for?	0
What?	It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.	0
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?	I'm sorry.	0
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.	Three to six hours.	0
Hi!	Ann. Hello.	0
Yeah...?	What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.	0
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.	Well...	0
I've been doing my homework.	Just like old times?	0
How will he do that?	That true, Fergus? You in love?	0
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?	Whoa.	0
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.	...He said that?	0
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..	There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.	0
What was that?	I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.	0
Yes.	You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?	0
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.	Your entire body?	0
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.	Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.	0
How's the detective business?	Come on!	0
About a year and a half.	I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.	0
Could you?	Where to?	0
Did you win?	You can't curse in front of it either.	0
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.	Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...	0
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.	What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?	0
What?	You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.	0
I'm saying it now!	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.	0
Mr Brown.	Ma'am.	0
We all have...	I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.	0
It's already started.	Yeah.	0
Yeah, I guess you're right.	I know that.	0
Can you show me?	Small moves, Captain, small moves.	0
May I cut in, miss?	Anything.	0
I'm going with you.	Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.	0
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!	Often, uh.	0
What?	He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.	0
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?	0
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.	What is this, Swana?	0
Take me away from here?	Home?	0
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.	You mean, we're stranded down here?!	0
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.	You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?	0
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?	How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.	0
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...	If you find her...	0
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.	I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--	0
May I offer you a drink?	Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.	0
You know what it takes.	This is insanity.  Sally...	0
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.	Well, whad'ya know...	0
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.	Ah.	0
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.	Good luck, Tracy.	0
Were you ever going to say anything?	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.	0
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.	Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!	0
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.	It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.	0
What?	No, come on. Anywhere you want.	0
I don't know.	I thought we were poor.	0
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.	Maybe I'm a quicker learner.	0
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.	Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?	0
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.	Say what you want and you'll see --	0
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.	If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --	0
Yes!	Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.	0
Dickie!	I'll go and see what's the matter.	0
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.	I will, don't worry.	0
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.	I know the feeling.	0
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.	Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.	0
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!	Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.	0
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?	The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...	0
What?	You take a lot for granted.	0
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?	It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.	0
Fifteen years, huh?	My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.	0
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?	It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.	0
Really?	Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.	0
...The people look like ants.	Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.	0
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.	Twombley involved?	0
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.	Oughta make 'em happy.	0
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.	Don't taste bad.	0
Ryan's really angry with me.	I think he's really angry with me too.	0
Why do you do these stupid things?!	I have to.	0
Stop this. This isn't funny.	Good night, Eve.	0
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...	I don't like to give up.	0
Yes.  I am.	In that case... no...	0
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?	To your husband.	0
I have to finish my job --	Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --	0
What other people?	Excuse me?	0
What are you doing here?	Let's go down to the basement.	0
What was her name?	What's your name?	0
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.	When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.	0
I got an awful bad cold.	That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?	0
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.	Office of--Senator Smith?	0
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.	I doubt that.	0
Why not?	Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.	0
I have to show you...	No!	0
What!	Yes?	0
Now you know why youíre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.	I like to read.	0
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?	I thought that you were anyway.	0
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?	Why should I believe you?	0
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.	I haven't forgotten.	0
Twelve years.	How did you get together?	0
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?	It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.	0
I'm going to class.	Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!	0
That's Ed.	Lock the door.	0
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?	I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.	0
Basically, yeah.	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.	0
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?	It's my birthday.	0
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.	This is too bad to be false.	0
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?	It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.	0
Do you realize I have light eyes?	But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.	0
No, sir. This is my own idea.	You sure those doors will be open?	0
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?	Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.	0
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?	Mid-town mostly.	0
Then why are you so upset?	Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.	0
Nick - I won't have you going down there.	Say you're the one who got me in this!	0
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?	You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.	0
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.	Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.	0
Are you afraid?	You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.	0
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.	I walk differently?	0
My pleasure.	Okay.	0
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.	Do you know what a Vampire-King is?	0
What are you guys gonna do?	Itís cute.	0
My mom is gone.	Where is she?	0
Do you like it?	Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.	0
Hi.	He was watching you.	0
I'm sorry. That is not my business.	My reputation seems to have preceded me.	0
What, again?	Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--	0
Buttons are Hochmut.	Hochmut?	0
I love Fort Holland.	I've lost my car.	0
I guess she's busy.	That's it.	0
Counts?	Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -ñ which by the way was a better book than a movie -ñ did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.	0
Spain.	Madrid or Barcelona?	0
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.	I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.	0
What, like a girdle?	Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.	0
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.	Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?	0
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.	What... Bo-... What about the magazine?	0
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.	Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!	0
Austin, what's your point?	What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --	0
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?	Go on - hit me!	0
Just my dad.	You told your dad?	0
After that.	I'll be there.	0
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?	How long have you been married?	0
You already went back to work.	What?	0
Goodbye.	It could have been marvelous ...	0
My God!	We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...	0
Right, for us. But...Iím afraid that if you get on that plane...	It hasn't been easy, has it?	0
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?	I don't know, they just did.	0
Yes.	You did? Was it anyone that you...?	0
I should go to the house, get breakfast.	It was a prop for the school play ...	0
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.	Seconds.  Three, four.	0
There's a light up ahead.	I know you will.	0
Really?	HARRY Dunne.	0
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?	You look beautiful. Your hair...	0
You know I can't do that.	Oh, I think you will.	0
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.	What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.	0
Yes I do!	And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.	0
Yeah, you would.	Well, i-if-if you have some free time...	0
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.	How did it end?	0
Well it's nice that you were there for her.	I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.	0
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?	My first take?	0
And I really wanted some ice cream too.	Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.	0
That help?	Thanks.	0
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?	And why haven't they left each other?	0
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.	Like family, huh?	0
What does that mean?	Not in love, exactly, but...	0
You really don't remember?	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?	0
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?	Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.	0
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?	By the hour of nine.	0
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.	Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -ñ which by the way was a better book than a movie -ñ did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.	0
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --	That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...	0
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....	I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.	0
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.	No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.	0
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...	So we don't know for sure about you, either.	0
We are?	Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.	0
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...	So when was I here?	0
Nice lines--	Yes--	0
I'm your sister.	Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?	0
I love you.	Love you too..	0
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.	You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.	0
That's right.  What's she doing?	A medicine man?	0
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.	A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.	0
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.	Too aggressive?	0
Give me the ball.	Well he can't have gone far.	0
I'm going home.	It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?	0
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.	That must have made you proud.	0
I bet you did lots of bad things.	...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?	0
Let's leave here.	We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.	0
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?	- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.	0
He's very... clean.	Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --	0
She back in Kansas?	It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.	0
I know. Don't say anything.	He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.	0
I'd identify him.	No --	0
Chip, your ride is here.	Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.	0
Okay. The woman just canít walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why canít you go to your Embassy?	Thank you, Ben.	0
You love me?	My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...	0
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.	I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...	0
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...	All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...	0
About the Ottos?	Do you have a lover now?	0
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!	Oh - I'll get it!	0
'Love will find out the way'.	'Love will find out the way'?	0
But he's interested!	Where did you get them developed?	0
'Course they're also so rich.	Siam.	0
Are they usually like that?	Edie, Edie, I...	0
That's right.	You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?	0
Yeah?	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.	0
... What do we do?	I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!	0
You really love me, don't you?	You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.	0
And I...I've got other things happening.	I'm sure we can match any offer.	0
I don't know.	Was it Albert?	0
Things can't get much worse can they?	I don't see how.	0
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.	Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?	0
So what?	Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.	0
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.	Your brother...	0
Why?	No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.	0
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.	Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.	0
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --	Where are they?	0
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?	Let's go, Reggie.	0
Oh.	Older than thirty?	0
Can we turn the light on?	That's not the way it's done.	0
Or believe, I'll bet.	Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.	0
Would they hurt her?	I don't know.	0
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?	What?	0
You lost me.	Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.	0
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...	--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.	0
Yes?	So I'm saying it...	0
For the dance.	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --	0
PLEASE? We have to!	I really don't think it's a good idea.	0
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?	A few?	0
Is there a difference?	Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!	0
Steve said for you to start on the boats.	I finished the boats.	0
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.	What do you actually know with religion?	0
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.	You mean like in the steam room?	0
The world of our children. How dare they?	Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...	0
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.	0
Normal.	Aren't you ever going to get married?	0
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.	Where is she?	0
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.	We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.	0
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.	Mm. And your like, what else?	0
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.	Happy anniversary.	0
I have?	I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.	0
Who was that?	I know. Goodbye.	0
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.	The Italian, I presume?	0
Can I stay a bit longer?	Stay forever.	0
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?	And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?	0
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?	No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.	0
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?	Youíre judging me?! Oh, thatís a good one. Youíre lying to me, youíre lying to your family, and youíre lying to yourself. But youíre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?	0
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?	But Elaine --	0
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.	I'd sooner wait outside.	0
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.	I guess we get what we pay for, huh?	0
This I gotta see.	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?	0
When did you decide?	It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.	0
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!	Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!	0
Would this be easier for you in the dark?	Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.	0
God, you're anatomically correct!	Did you speak to my father?	0
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!	Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.	0
Just like that.	Well I don't.	0
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.	Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.	0
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.	Answer the phone.	0
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.	Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.	0
Should we get a what?	points at the motel.	0
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --	C'mere, Nanook.	0
I want you to come with me on Monday.	Good.  There.  Yes?	0
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.	Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.	0
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.	And you?	0
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.	I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?	0
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.	Charles, what time is it?	0
Maybe you should be.	You heard.	0
And your point?	I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.	0
Yeah.	I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.	0
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.	- - a gizzard - -	0
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?	Get - get up!	0
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.	I thought we were poor.	0
You were brilliant today.	You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.	0
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.	0
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?	Was he swallowed?	0
Go where?	On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.	0
Would you like a drink now?	You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?	0
Something's happened to them.	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.	0
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"	Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.	0
Nobody.	But who were they?	0
We should act out our inner most fantasies.	Great!!!	0
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.	Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?	0
Look, are you coming or not?	Uh-huh.	0
It makes me sad.	You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.	0
Yes.	-- fuck you.	0
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	0
I saw an article...	C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.	0
What do you want from me?	Yeah.	0
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.	I actually know this one.	0
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?	No shit.  You got someplace in mind?	0
Your portable reed organ....the piano.	Well, it's fine. Thank you.	0
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.	Well, wait.	0
But you're old!	I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?	0
No, Nick, no --	You're in on this.	0
Could you see her?	Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...	0
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?	Yes, I am rather.	0
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.	I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.	0
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.	Anti social?	0
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!	I'm not gonna kill anybody.	0
I'm taking you to the hospital.	Um-hm. Live sound.	0
Why not?	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.	0
Writing seems easy.	It's a breeze.	0
What's it about?	That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.	0
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.	Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.	0
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!	0
Trubshaw again? What now?	I said that?	0
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.	Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.	0
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-	All you got to do is name it.	0
Perfectly absurd.	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.	0
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.	A Volkswagen.	0
Is that the mail?	Yeah.	0
And they won't be able to tell?	No ... They won't be able to tell.	0
Yes.	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?	0
I thought you were enjoying yourself?	Order me a pastrami for after?	0
And this is Helen Carter.	How about tonight?	0
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?	No -- they don't.	0
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...	Of course.	0
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.	I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.	0
So how are you really doing, Panes?	Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...	0
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. IóI did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?	Which people?	0
You have a helluva way of asking for help.	Sure. Thanks.	0
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.	0
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.	Then what?	0
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?	No dog.	0
Let's just do it, all right?	Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?	0
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --	I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.	0
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.	0
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...	I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.	0
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.	Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.	0
Fine.	Like Japanese food.	0
Hi.	Nice dress.	0
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.	Really?	0
Nothing.	Look, I'm no expert, but--	0
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.	No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.	0
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!	No.	0
You know where she is?	If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.	0
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?	Care to wait a decent interval?	0
Good-night dad.	Good night kiddo.	0
Barely.	Now, Aim --	0
I'm going back home.	They're in the basement.	0
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.	0
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.	How long have I been here?	0
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.	Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.	0
You left me at the hospital.	I'm sorry.	0
On which boat?	Fun.	0
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...	You don't act like it.	0
I'm in the middle.	Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?	0
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."	No...F	0
I thought they came right past here óó	I know that.	0
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!	David? You call your teacher David?	0
Just...leave it alone.	I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...	0
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?	But Lana, you could --	0
Why are you asking me all this?	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.	0
What?	Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --	0
You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.	0
I want to know if my sister is here.	Here?	0
The brunette.  The one you told me about.	Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!	0
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.	See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.	0
I can't....	Yes you can....	0
So that's it, just forget about us?	I'm out of here.  Jenny.	0
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?	That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.	0
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."	Easy, easy --	0
Friend?	It was a mercy-killing after all.	0
But it's Christmas now.	Breakfast.	0
Who?	No one would miss me.	0
He and his wife splitting up?	It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.	0
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.	I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...	0
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.	I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.	0
I don't know where you'd start.	No.	0
What is it?	It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.	0
How's not smoking?	Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?	0
I read George Jean Nathan every week.	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.	0
Well, sure.	That was just a mix up.	0
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?	I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.	0
I think it went on rather too long.	I couldn't bear for it to end.	0
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.	What'd you see?	0
Do you like my body?	Sure I do.	0
Why not?	Right. Seven.  Christ, thatís a long time, isnít it?	0
I don't know.	How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --	0
What?	Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.	0
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.	Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!	0
I watched TV.	Better make it charge.	0
That's an evasion.	She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every dayówhether it's coming to her or not.	0
You know you can come under the blanket.	So do I.	0
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.	And what is your name?	0
Where could he have gone?	Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...	0
Dead gaiijin's are big news.	Gaiijin?	0
A good reason, I suppose.	Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...	0
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.	So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?	0
He knows it well.	The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.	0
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...	Maybe it's time for a vacation.	0
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!	I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!	0
Can't we change course?	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.	0
Oh, that's nice...	Watch your language.	0
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.	Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.	0
Do you think you could answer that?	I love you too.	0
I'm sorry, Mike.	Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...	0
A figure of St. Sebastian.	More or less.	0
Can I get you something?	Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.	0
...Ray?	People watched the movies in their cars?	0
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!	0
Ok.	Sure.	0
Fine.	Let's go, Jake?	0
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.	I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --	0
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.	No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.	0
Of course.	Good.	0
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.	George?	0
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."	I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.	0
...she has a <u>home</u>...	...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?	0
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.	Oh, how did you get burnt-out?	0
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.	The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...	0
Yeah?	I'll wait for you till seven.	0
So you're gonna bitch up?	Its powers are strong.	0
I won't, I swear.	I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.	0
Up front?	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?	0
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.	Jesus.	0
You tell me.	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	0
That's cop bullshit.	Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.	0
It's not okay.  It's extortion.	What did you tell him?	0
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.	I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.	0
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.	I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.	0
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!	Uh...over easy.	0
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.	If you want.  But...	0
Really?	Muffy -- coffee?	0
You've killed women?	Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!	0
Yes, while he was here.	While he was here. You went about together?	0
What are we gonna do?	Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.	0
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.	Oh my God.	0
Yeah.  All over.	It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?	0
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.	0
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Heís not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subís reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.	The doctor? Was the doctor here?	0
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...	That's very interesting, Eve.	0
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.	I'll talk to him later.	0
I don't like your following me.	I didn't follow you.	0
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?	Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!	0
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.	It's been a tough day.	0
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.	0
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?	You have no idea what's going on.	0
Get on the bus.	Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...	0
To the Riviera.	No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?	0
We'll go later.	We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?	0
No scars?	No scars.	0
Adrian.	What?	0
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.	Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.	0
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.	Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.	0
We just live one flight up.	Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?	0
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.	Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.	0
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.	I'm not leaving without that tape.	0
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...	I assume he licked it clean.	0
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.	And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.	0
I'm going home.	Where's that?	0
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.	What old mill? Is that somewhere we --	0
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.	I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.	0
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.	Neither did I.	0
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...	Ettore must be fed up with me by now.	0
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.	0
You what?	Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!	0
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.	Mommy, please don't call me that.	0
Charisma?	Or something.	0
With Robert Redford, when he was young.	Yeah...	0
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.	Oh, yeah, sure.	0
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.	Patch him through....	0
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.	Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.	0
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?	My life is a living hell.	0
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.	Really.	0
But not you.	Why won't you talk to me?	0
Wer ist da?	How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.	0
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.	It's not a game.  Something you play.	0
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.	I dunno, boy.	0
But do you agree with me?	Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.	0
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?	Just for luck.	0
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.	Okay, don't stop.	0
I wish to be your wife.	So...?	0
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.	No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.	0
Fabrizio said you might be up --	Sssshh. Come here.	0
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.	Thought you liked me, bitch.	0
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?	No. Black.	0
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.	And splittin' with her?	0
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.	That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!	0
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?	You've been with someone!	0
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?	There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.	0
Maybe we ought to leave.	Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.	0
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.	Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...	0
Augh.	Augh?	0
So you'll come to the wedding, right?	Let's go tell your Mother.	0
What are you saying?	Why aren't you understanding?	0
You fit another Chanel suit in here?	Something better.  Open it.	0
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?	Come again?	0
Look! Police!	I know. I called them.	0
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.	Just follow me.	0
Didn't get much sleep.	I thought so, too.	0
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.	0
Are you all right?	... right as rain.	0
Is there someplace we can talk?	How about the Rainbow Room?	0
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.	God, I never thought of that.	0
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.	He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?	0
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.	Oh God...	0
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...	Try not to think about it.	0
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.	Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.	0
Only minimum security.	Just take deep breaths.	0
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?	What do you want, a joke?	0
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!	Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.	0
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.	I won't.	0
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today ó let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?	You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."	0
That wasn't in there before.	How're you getting on?	0
KipÖ I -	I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.	0
You don't care if I die	Sure, I do	0
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.	We'll need one.	0
No, I couldn't.	He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.	0
Were they trying to kill you?					*	I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.	0
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.	You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?	0
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.	Yes.	0
Brian I want him out of our car!	Why, what did he do?	0
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?	Okay, boy, beat it.	0
Because you're in trouble.	All right.	0
All set for what?	I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.	0
You okay?	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.	0
I'm sorry about what I said.	Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.	0
... Do you think we should look for him?	No one's gonna hurt you no more.	0
Do you think the rabbit did it?	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.	0
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?	Yes -- I believe you do.	0
Oh, yeah.	No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.	0
Stop it.	I can't till the hatch is flooded!	0
What's funny?	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.	0
Not yet, dear brother...	Send them out!	0
Come in.  Hi.	Well, I detected an undercurrent.	0
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...	Come on.  Kids love horror.	0
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.	0
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.	You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...	0
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...	Doesn't matter.	0
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?	I do not know what you are referring to.	0
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?	...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.	0
I...	It's just a city park.	0
That is idle talk.	You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.	0
Why all the way to Del Rio?	Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.	0
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.	Well, it was a silly question.	0
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?	There's something I have to tell you...	0
Aye, sir.	I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...	0
How?	What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.	0
It's because of Jacqueline óó I can't go on looking for her --	Don't call me Father.	0
Oh, God!	I am.  You-you made my day.	0
What's the magician's weapon?	Sorry.  It's your baby now.	0
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.	No rawness.	0
What?	Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?	0
There you go with those moves again.	Too aggressive?	0
I know, but --	Ah.	0
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.	You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.	0
What <u>was</u> that thing?	How should <u>I know</u>?	0
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!	All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.	0
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.	What's the matter with you?	0
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?	0
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.	But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.	0
I guess you're new around here.	How long have you been married?	0
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...	The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.	0
And that was only my first try.	Well perhaps better than my first.	0
You can have anything you want.	You want some?	0
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.	I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.	0
Yes.	Get on it.	0
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?	No; who were the three, besides me?	0
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.	But you didn't hurt --	0
Makes no difference.  Get him out.	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.	0
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?	0
No.	Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.	0
You're not stupid.	I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...	0
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...	Their power. They seduce me.	0
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...	Have you slept with him yet?	0
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.	Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.	0
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.	You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?	0
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.	I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.	0
We? Don't blame me!	It wasn't supposed to happen like this.	0
But don't they have it in English?	Who?	0
They would have killed you too.	Do you know why I'm here?	0
And now you can?	No.	0
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.	You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.	0
My relationship with God is my own.	But you think about Him -- It -- Her.	0
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...	Uh...	0
xxxxxx	xxxxxx	0
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.	Really? Any problems?	0
Oh, for Christ's sake ñ-	My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?	0
I am not!	Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?	0
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.	I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.	0
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.	0
Look at me.	Because he likes you.	0
What did you say?	Nothing.	0
You're late.	Are you torturing me on purpose?	0
Oh -- Okay.	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.	0
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.	Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.	0
What didn't you like about her?	Then I will go with you.	0
He's got the shakes?	Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?	0
Uh-huh.	I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.	0
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.	0
That's hard to imagine....	I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....	0
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.	0
I have a very low resistance.	Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?	0
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?	Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...	0
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?	Tell me I don't have something to do with it.	0
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.	0
Sugar?	Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?	0
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--	Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.	0
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	0
Please. Why not?	Because it was a lie.	0
I will be in just a minute.	You work around town?	0
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.	Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.	0
No time.	And, take some more pictures.	0
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.	Just good luck.	0
Well -- you want me?	Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?	0
What do you like to drink?	Big talk... Desperate guy.	0
For what?	Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?	0
Oh, no.	... what?...	0
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.	What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?	0
Where did you get that?	A Runner gave it to me.	0
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.	Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.	0
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.	I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.	0
That's a long time.	Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.	0
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.	0
I insist.	Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.	0
You think I'm rich and you hate me.	Good.  There.  Yes?	0
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.	I don't understand.	0
Uh-huh.	So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.	0
What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know... Jackie?	0
Oh Clark, no!	Yeah.	0
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?	Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...	0
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...	They just finished supper.	0
So what's the point?	It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.	0
Last time you were gone for a week!	Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?	0
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.	0
Call and tell you.	And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?	0
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.	What are they?	0
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?	Tható  óword again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .	0
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?	I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.	0
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?	I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.	0
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.	To calm your anxiety.	0
How?	Mine too.	0
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.	Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...	0
Great.  Another deadbeat.	I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.	0
Gage's gone!	You mean she just found out?	0
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.	He's alright, but my Dad can take him.	0
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?	I didn't know you were going with him.	0
Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.	0
I have to go back now.	We'll talk about it in the car.	0
You going there?	Right.	0
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.	Did you give her the money?	0
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?	She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.	0
How'd you like a punch in the nose?	Marcia, please.	0
Why not?	Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.	0
A little longer, Paul?	You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...	0
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.	I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?	0
Later?	Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.	0
I know, just let me sleep	Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...	0
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.	I'll die either way.	0
Father--oh.	Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.	0
We'll try again.	No way. I've got to get out now.	0
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....	Yes?	0
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?	What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?	0
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.	I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --	0
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.	0
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.	That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.	0
I will, David!	I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.	0
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.	Trying to write our report....	0
You're a sweet man, Richard.	I guess part of us never really leaves high school.	0
I've missed you.	Eight stories.	0
Scott...	I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.	0
This is all very pleasant but why are here?	I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.	0
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.	Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?	0
It's my favorite place --	Yeah, we have something great, Vick.	0
Sit down, Jake.	You'll learn.	0
Doc...	Who's "they"?	0
<u>What</u>!	Two kids tried to set me on fire.	0
What're you doing here?	I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.	0
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.	The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.	0
You're impossible....	Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.	0
What's that?	"Ein hurigan" - I guess.	0
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.	No.  Doris.	0
Yeah?	I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.	0
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.	Yes, ma'am.	0
What is he being charged with?	I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.	0
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.	Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."	0
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...	You could sleep, too, couldn't you?	0
No.	I bet you hear everything I say!	0
So simple to say, so hard to do.	Not when you have no choice.	0
Is that what you want?	Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.	0
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."	You're so predictable.	0
What?	Let me think a second.  It's tough.	0
He's not home.	Where can I find him?	0
It's ok to ask that.	Come on Dorothy.	0
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.	Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...	0
They were early.	Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.	0
What's up?	I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...	0
Like what?	Commercials.	0
That's really something.	Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.	0
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.	Sure... I'll see you around.	0
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?	HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.	0
...gger.	Say, 'Nigger.'	0
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.	I don't understand why they're getting you involved.	0
What kind of man does that!?	Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.	0
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?	Just Jim.	0
I-I can do the job, sir.	You don't sound too enthusiastic.	0
Sail?	Uh-huh?	0
Harry? Harry, where are you?!	Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?	0
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.	What is wrong with me?	0
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.	If it was a ship she hit.	0
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?	Yes, it's-it's wonderful.	0
You're not capable of it.	I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?	0
Sorry. Iím a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.	Aw, Baby.	0
You were talking in your sleep.	Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.	0
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.	And more...	0
Oh!	Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.	0
Why?	Just...say...no!	0
What's up?	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?	0
Does it make it easier to win?	Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instanceóa natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that heó	0
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?	Is that the way it was with you?	0
Excuse me?	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.	0
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.	I'm already hurting.	0
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.	Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...	0
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.	That's ok.	0
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.	Outstanding.	0
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.	It looks nice.	0
Trix...	Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!	0
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.	Can't do that now, though, can you?	0
What?	Let me have it.	0
You're not going out to look for them?	You think you're kidding.	0
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.	Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.	0
Sure did.	Everything went to his head.	0
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?	Yes you do.	0
I hope you're comfortable.	Yes. I am.	0
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.	You mean like going to the pictures?	0
No, I want my cut!	You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.	0
Were you with Jamie?	I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.	0
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.	Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.	0
Not gonna let me in?	Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?	0
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.	You think she sure 'nough your sister?	0
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --	I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?	0
Get out of our way.	We're in Pleasantville?	0
Really?	Yeah.	0
How long does it last?	Three to six hours.	0
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.	I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!	0
With ten thousand? Nine.	He's got that kinda money?	0
How's the water?	Nerves.	0
What!?	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?	0
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?	If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.	0
Are you supposed to be here?	I've got you worried, haven't I?	0
Well, good night, Louis.	Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?	0
I'm telling you you can't.	But he wants me to come!	0
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--	I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?	0
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?	It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?	0
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?	That's right.	0
You were saying...	Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?	0
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.	You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?	0
Oh?	The Shostakovich.	0
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...	Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.	0
No, no.	It sounded like you did.	0
Yes, well...	Yeah.  I am.	0
Are you tired of it?	I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?	0
I never lied to you.	I know.	0
By myself?	Thank you.	0
You can't!	I have to.	0
Did you lose something?	Yes. I lost my remote control.	0
You weren't so bad yourself.	Yes.	0
Blow it up?	We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...	0
Sure.	Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.	0
Are you really that brave?	Ever ask him?	0
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.	0
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.	No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.	0
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?	You better pray, gal. You better pray...	0
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.	Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.	0
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.	Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.	0
What can we do?	Which?	0
Are you from Washington originally?	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.	0
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.	But you're OK?	0
What?	So you weren't interested in music at all?	0
What are you doing with all these blueprints?	Some buildings I'm working on.	0
That's why I'm crying.	Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?	0
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.	No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.	0
I don't mind if I do.	But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.	0
I am calm.	I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!	0
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	How's that?	0
Next week "East Lynne."	Done.	0
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.	Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.	0
Don't toy with me, Doctor.	I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --	0
Really?  It makes me sick.	Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.	0
I don't give a damn about the gold.	I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.	0
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.	Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.	0
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?	What are we about to do?	0
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?	Beautiful.	0
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.	Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.	0
What do you think?	It's the best collection I've ever seen.	0
Signs?	Well, we were just...	0
You can stop right there.	Yeah? Allison what?	0
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.	Our Peter?	0
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.	You-you play... very well.	0
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???	0
Hey Josh.	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?	0
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?	Um...	0
He's Black, OK?	Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.	0
No, he's not.	Yeah.	0
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.	No, she's with her sister,	0
You're going hunting?	Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.	0
Did they ever find out who they were?	Don't you agree, Jacques?	0
Pablo said no?	Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.	0
What?  You know him?	So?	0
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!	Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.	0
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?	I waited another four minutes.	0
Why are you here. Whatiya want?	Because...  I was already dead.	0
Apparently I can disappear.	Please tell me you go silent too.	0
Why do you ask?	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.	0
What happens when you lose?	To calm your anxiety.	0
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...	Will you shut up!?!!	0
They tried to kill you?	Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.	0
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?	Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.	0
Forever.	Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?	0
Is everything all right?	I gotta go out for a while.	0
People are expendable to Bodhi.	Meaning you were expendable.	0
But they'd still get the idea, right?	You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?	0
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.	He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.	0
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.	There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.	0
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.	Oh really?	0
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.	Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --	0
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?	I'm curious.	0
Tell me.	Goodnight.  Where was she?	0
Four billion dollars.	I'll take you home if you'd like.	0
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...	Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.	0
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?	Yes.	0
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?	A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?	0
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...	Yeah.	0
Here. Why am I looking at this star?	Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.	0
What makes you ask?	I'm not sure.	0
Oh.	Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?	0
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!	Things change!	0
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.	There are only two other alternatives for him.	0
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!	No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.	0
I thought I'd give it to you.	All right.	0
I have a surprise for you.	I bet.	0
And Joel's pre-med.	The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.	0
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?	Sort of half.....	0
And what if I didnít want you to...to do that to me?	You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.	0
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?	Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.	0
How did you get here?	Frances, You're crazy.	0
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...	You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.	0
Miller, come in...	We can do it!	0
I love you Don with all my heart.	No, it's not Don.	0
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!	You're right -- I am a coward.	0
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...	Who's responsible?!	0
I know.	You're looking great, baby.	0
I was?	There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.	0
Who's that?	In some situations.	0
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.	He left!	0
Sorry, old man. Work.	Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?	0
No.	You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.	0
Nope. No complaints.	It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.	0
Well, ain't that the truth...	Yes. It is.	0
Okay.	I love you...	0
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.	No short game.	0
Excuse me.	Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.	0
Do you want me to go...?	Not if you think like a Vegan.	0
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.	You talking to me?	0
Why do you have to defend her?	I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.	0
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.	What is the Northcountry Development Association?	0
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."	He was nervous.	0
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.	Me too.	0
That's it! That's the reason!	I don't know.	0
That's not my handwriting.	You've just said you signed it.	0
Are you okay?	It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...	0
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.	Yeah...	0
Sailor? You know what?	No.	0
Yeah.	Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?	0
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.	Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?	0
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.	0
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.	Right here in the van.	0
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.	Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.	0
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.	Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.	0
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?	It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.	0
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.	First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.	0
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?	Ernie's.	0
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...	Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!	0
But it's a small room, Jason.	It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it óó to know me better.	0
You heard what Abbott said?	The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.	0
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!	And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?	0
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?	Bigger?	0
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...	Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...	0
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.	He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.	0
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	Well...	0
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.	Exactly what do you need?	0
You made me look like an idiot --	Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.	0
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!	Hear, hear...	0
You're my mother's hairdresser?	What about what?	0
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.	So why did you come to my casino?	0
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.	After dinner I'll show you my puppets.	0
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.	Come here.	0
Sit down, Benjamin.	Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --	0
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.	I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".	0
So you lied to her?	Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.	0
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?	Yes -- that's right. Production for use.	0
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.	There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.	0
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.	Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.	0
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?	Would you?	0
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.	What did you see?	0
They don't bother me.	That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...	0
I've got something for you.	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.	0
Permanent damage.	You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.	0
He wants your wisdom.	Let's have dinner first.	0
You sure?	We haven't.	0
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!	Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.	0
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.	Don't get funny with me again.	0
What's wrong?	Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.	0
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Iím a coward.	Anybody ever done that to you before?	0
Well then, I'll pray for rain.	See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.	0
Don't make me... me... me... get up!	Who we gonna beat?	0
In Terry Canyon?	Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.	0
Hi Tom.	You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.	0
Could it be intelligent?	Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.	0
Fired?	You're crazy! You can't do that!	0
How is he?	Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...	0
Do you enjoy it?	When they deserve it.	0
Um-hum ...	Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.	0
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.	Sorry if I crossed you up.	0
I musta been stoned.	You wanna drink?	0
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?	The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.	0
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.	Your father?	0
I'm not your daughter.	Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.	0
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.	What in the world would give me that idea?	0
Do you have a phone?	Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?	0
He's gay! Enrique is gay!	Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?	0
You mean, he might be hiding there?	I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.	0
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.	I've noticed.	0
Yeah.	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.	0
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.	Are you honest?	0
Harmless - how?	Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.	0
Don't you want to know my name?	I already know it, Mary.	0
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."	Yes.	0
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.	Nothing.	0
Kiss me and I'll tell you.	A list.	0
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --	Susan. What are you doing?	0
Is that right?	It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.	0
Of course I'm sure.	What about you? Do you and your father get along?	0
So?	So that means I have to ride with you.	0
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?	No, no.	0
Get out.	Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?	0
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?	Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?	0
You were?	Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.	0
What now?	Hang on. I have to leave a message.	0
DonÌt Jim.	Yes.	0
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.	Get a highway patrol unit over there.	0
He's your son.	Small talk.	0
You scared me.	You want some punch?	0
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.	You could have a great beach house for that.	0
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.	0
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --	Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.	0
Him?	'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?	0
Sporting events, yeah.	Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.	0
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.	Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.	0
What a nose.  You missed your calling.	Can I open it?	0
It's a place to live, that's all.	I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.	0
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."	Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.	0
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.	Where?	0
We must!	With no laser --	0
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?	Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.	0
You and he are not doing things?	It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.	0
What's he doing daddy?	Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--	0
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.	Saddest thing I ever heard.	0
Yes.	You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.	0
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?	Rose... please...	0
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?	Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.	0
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?	Sooner, the better.	0
Caesar, what are we going to do?	They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.	0
Why?	... just, you could look very heavy...	0
Sam.	No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.	0
Wer ist da?	Me.	0
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.	If you've lived a good life, fought well--	0
Oh, my.	What happened to you?	0
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?	I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.	0
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.	Very funny.	0
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.	The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.	0
Oh, please...	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.	0
But what about...	I'll take care of myself --	0
Come back some other time, will you?	Yeah, sure. Good luck.	0
This is horse?	No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.	0
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?	I feel good anyways.	0
<u>Who</u>?	Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....	0
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?	0
At least I'm open to new concepts!	Agreed.	0
Just think about it.	Good luck, Tracy.	0
This is Annie MacLean.	Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.	0
Guess they're up.	Sounds big.  What's he do?	0
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.	0
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?	Hi, Charlie.	0
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.	Now don't start this.	0
Can't we change course?	I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.	0
Do you?	No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.	0
You're upset.	I'm not upset.	0
Shouldn't we pick him up?	Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.	0
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?	I wanted you to.	0
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?	Never quit a winner.	0
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?	That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.	0
Twelve months in oak.	They think I have a concussion.	0
I bet you're ticklish.	Ticklish?	0
The suit will stretch. You should try it --	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.	0
No ó- not yet.	And I never will- you know what's between us ó we're a thing But this is serious competition.	0
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....	And?	0
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.	0
Oh, I like that tone.	Why did you quit?	0
Panes?	What? You called Mommy? Just now?	0
Yeah.	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.	0
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?	I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.	0
You're not ready.	Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?	0
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?	How'd you guess?	0
Cool.	I'm starving.	0
All moorings are clear, Captain.	I love you too, Francie.	0
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.	I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.	0
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.	Burgel doesn't like anybody!	0
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.	How come you don't stay with them?	0
I don't.	Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?	0
Big Edís.	Big Edís?  Big Edís Tires?  Why...?	0
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.	And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.	0
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --	Paul? Yeah. You think --	0
You're talking like a drunk.	That's what I am.	0
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!	Get a hold of yourself.	0
Stay in him forever?	No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?	0
Just like it.	I'm not going.	0
The number.	What?	0
I'm not leaving without you.	You don't understand. The Thirst --	0
About what?	No chance of that.	0
Yes, but...	We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.	0
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...	Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...	0
A dozen times.	Too bleeding true, 'n' it.	0
Mm hmm.	You got it all in your head?	0
Are you nervous, Walter?	N-no...	0
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?	In a harem.	0
I'll just boost the doses.	Please, Barton.	0
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....	He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --	0
You've been watching the film.	Tell me about the girl.	0
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!	He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?	0
Truth?	Sure.	0
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.	It's the truth.	0
You got kids?	The man downstairs said number--	0
This is going right up your ass.	Come on.	0
Who's the guy, who's the wife?	Out. I've got things to do.	0
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--	--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.	0
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...	0
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.	Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-	0
Do what?	I don't know.	0
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.	Oh, how did you get burnt-out?	0
Yes.	Thank you.	0
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?	Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.	0
You've got to be kidding.	I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.	0
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.	I'm sorry.	0
My fault.	You're not hurt, are you?	0
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?	Yes.	0
Want a hit?	Sure.	0
You know you can come under the blanket.	It's alright.	0
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?	Italy!	0
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.	Cameron. You remember Cameron.	0
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?	Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.	0
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.	His name?	0
Where's the bloody -	- torque wrench.	0
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....	You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.	0
Happy for him.  And relieved.	That's a lot of those.	0
What d'you mean?	Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!	0
That's illegal, you know.	My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.	0
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.	Oh, right.  Sorry.	0
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.	That's it?	0
No. It's a mess.	Yeah, I'll do you a favour.	0
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.	Is that what you want?	0
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.	Okay, I get it.	0
Why, Craig. why?	I... puppeteer.	0
You don't talk very much.	Yes.	0
You talk to the married couple?	Where's the one you're building?	0
Who are you!  Who are you!	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.	0
Harry, we spoke with Martin.	'We?'	0
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.	Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.	0
With computers.	It's not the same, is it?	0
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?	I just thought maybe you and me could--	0
I'm fine.	And who did the voice belong to?	0
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.	That's what we want to find out.	0
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.	Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.	0
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.	Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.	0
YES.	Maxine.	0
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.	I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...	0
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.	Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.	0
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.	I take out my slim-jim...	0
He made a mistake.	I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?	0
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?	Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?	0
That movie makes me feel guilty.	Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.	0
What?	It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.	0
I thought you'd be pleased.	Bad people.	0
That's life.  My kisses are alive.	Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?	0
Yeah.	Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.	0
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.	Datura.	0
Helen got it for me in Oslo.	God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!	0
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.	Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. ñI'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.	0
What's with you two?	Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.	0
But you have had mistresses while you were away.	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?	0
Will you take me back to my grandparents?	I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.	0
I'll give notice.	Well, what else does?	0
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?	He's rich.	0
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...	It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.	0
Yeah -- being a basket case.	Very thoughtful.	0
I don't understan' it, Tom.	Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?	0
And so you did your job, right?	Yes, mam...	0
Sure.	Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?	0
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?	Perfect.	0
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!	That penguin last night, is he one of them?	0
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.	How do you know it's a she?	0
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.	Hello, glad to meet you.	0
But you was going to fight for me.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.	0
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!	For chrissake give me a hand!	0
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.	Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?	0
Tomorrow morning.	No -- now.	0
George --	I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?	0
What about...	What about what?	0
You're next, Norman.	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.	0
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.	Really?	0
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.	I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.	0
May I ask your name?	Tonight then.	0
Why?	Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.	0
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!	0
People do amazing things when they're scared.	Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --	0
I canít stay here.	Hang on!	0
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.	0
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?	It doesn't make any difference anymore.	0
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.	0
Yes.	Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.	0
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.	0
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...	Just taking your photo.	0
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.	If you say so.  It could be anything.	0
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.	0
Amazing.	Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.	0
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.	Good for you.  Good for you	0
Then why do you hate me so much?	When did I say I hated you?	0
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --	I didn't see that.	0
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.	Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?	0
What are we waiting for? Let's go.	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?	0
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?	You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?	0
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?	0
Well, I am.	I'll say.	0
Peter Kelson?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.	0
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.	Happy now?	0
Really.  What'll I pin this on?	Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.	0
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?	What?	0
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.	Yes?	0
Moreover...	Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?	0
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.	Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.	0
I want to experience childbirth.	With a, with a stranger?  With a--	0
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.	And your point is?	0
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!	What do you mean, we don't?	0
Where to?	Well it's fucking time.	0
You mean they don't have hookers.	I told her it was the fuck of the century.	0
So make an exception.	Shit!	0
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --	Let me jingle you right now.	0
Thanks for calling.	Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.	0
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."	"Go Get 'Em, Honey."	0
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...	No!  I have to get there.	0
I thought you were going to help Carl.	Carl can wait.	0
No.  Did he really?	Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...	0
Buddy...	Takes one to know one.	0
Feel good?	No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.	0
Yeah, well... me neither...	You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?	0
You mean, the insurance frammis?	Read a lot about you, Nick.	0
Well, how much would you like?	Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.	0
You came back for the book? Why?	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?	0
What'd I say?	"Hey, yourself."	0
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.	So do I, love.	0
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.	I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.	0
Oh!	Go right over there.	0
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.	Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?	0
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?	I don't know.	0
Why not?	Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.	0
What do you expect me to say?	Hannah and I are in the last stages.	0
How would you like to take me to dinner?	I don't know.	0
Matt, come here!	I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.	0
How did you land that?	I'm sure.	0
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.	But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?	0
Oh.	I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.	0
I was her best friend.	Whoa.	0
A satellite dish?	Well I was just throwing out ideas...	0
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?	I got them all, Mother.	0
Is he going to be alright?	His heart's beating.	0
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.	Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.	0
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --	That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.	0
Yeah.	A heavy drinker?	0
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw‰ngler?	You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.	0
You're very rude... if you don't come back --	It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?	0
The minute I read that script I said...	Bigger?	0
What was she like?	Don't wake the kids...	0
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.	You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?	0
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.	We're way past inappropriate.	0
Do you?	Elaine -- that is not what happened.	0
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?	She's haze grey and underway...	0
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --	I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!	0
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.	Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.	0
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?	You use words like that, you might make me mad.	0
Yeah?	Oh, babe...	0
"Thirty-two?"	Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.	0
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!	Maybe he likes older women.	0
He only shot you once.	The disc is still in there.	0
You got a girl?	What do you mean?	0
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.	That so.	0
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -	Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?	0
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --	-- not yet --	0
Who are you?	I said: don't look.	0
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.	Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -	0
Help cook?	Doesn't that scare you?	0
You think?	Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.	0
Killed?	Oh I think you do.	0
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...	What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.	0
Are you clean?	Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!	0
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.	What happened to Cole?	0
This whole place?	Why not?	0
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.	How long have you been married?	0
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!	Hey, wait a minute...	0
You never said anything.  About the drapes.	I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --	0
Lovebirds, sir?	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?	0
Can we go there now?	Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.	0
He served on the Goliath.	Wasn't that ship destroyed?	0
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?	Sheila...	0
Why not?	Shut up. I'm not listening.	0
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.	Rough?	0
He's *paralyzed*!	Hurry!!!	0
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.	Yeah? What have you been up to?	0
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.	That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.	0
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!	How long will I live?  That no one can say.	0
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...	It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.	0
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.	Thank you.	0
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.	What are you going to do, Rose?	0
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?	Five.	0
Is she coming back?	Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?	0
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?	Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.	0
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.	Oh, I was gonna say ...	0
Good. I want to talk to you.	I'm all tied up.  I can't.	0
It's already started, Dad... with me.	I know.	0
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.	It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?	0
I'm leaving you Jake.	Sure, what else is new?	0
Yes.	Really? How many?	0
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	0
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.	So tell me, how's it going?	0
It's cold.	Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?	0
OK...it's open.	Seen one like it before?	0
Something like thirty-six.	The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?	0
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.	Okay, Sammy.	0
I tell you this is half sold.	All right. Be careful.	0
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.	Yet another spaghetti night.	0
What?	Um. You're doing all right.	0
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.	When?	0
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.	Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!	0
I don't wanna talk to you.	We walked all night...	0
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?	I didn't care about the money.	0
What's that?	All right.	0
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.	Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.	0
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.	Bless me, I thought it was a horse.	0
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.	So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.	0
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...	Wasn't up to me.	0
Because you asked him to, stupid.	Oh yeah, I forgot.	0
And now you can?	Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.	0
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."	No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.	0
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.	You're in therapy?	0
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.	Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --	0
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?	I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.	0
Were any of them prettier than I am?	They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.	0
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.	You're mushing it a little around the--	0
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.	I thought only action movies had villains like that.	0
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?	What have you discovered?	0
What?	For who?	0
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.	I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.	0
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.	Why?	0
You meanó  óby the neck or something?	Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.	0
Why is it wrong to run?	I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.	0
She haven't even called you?	The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.	0
More or less.	Lindenmeyer?	0
Maybe we should back off a bit.	I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.	0
I heard you playing.	I often do.	0
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.	What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?	0
Bullshit.	-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.	0
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?	Told you not to call your mama.	0
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.	Who the devil is he?	0
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?	What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.	0
Your guitar is named Kimber?	What's it...	0
Major, Major... he's here ...	I hear that's a rather popular date.	0
Ah, let me have a little fun.	So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.	0
Uh-huh.	No, I'm sure.	0
Swear on my life.	Well...I'm pretty sure I've --	0
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...	I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...	0
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.	I know, I know, I know.	0
What's wrong?	Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --	0
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?	My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.	0
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...	Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.	0
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.	We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.	0
And what's this right girl like?	Carl can wait.	0
What year are you in?	No. The Old Man died and Louise left.	0
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.	Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --	0
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...	Last year? It can't be that long.	0
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --	Who's there?	0
Talk? About me--about us?	A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.	0
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?	Bitch, bitch, bitch!	0
Jack!	No thanks, Diz.	0
I want to sleep... forever...	Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!	0
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?	What?	0
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..	How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..	0
Yes. Why?	You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.	0
For what?	For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...	0
Well.  Word gets around.	...what <u>hindered</u> you...?	0
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.	Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.	0
Cal, stop! It was an accident.	That's not the way it's done.	0
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...	Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.	0
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?	Okay.	0
So what I want doesn't matter?	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!	0
Where do I pull off...?	Don't you <u>realize</u>--	0
You have a helluva way of asking for help.	You have a helluva way of answering.	0
James...	And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.	0
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?	No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.	0
Excuse me?	I'm not in the mood.	0
He was doing his job....	It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....	0
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?	Yes.	0
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.	0
I don't have to do what you say.	Man, forget you then, stupid.	0
Not what you think. We're very happily married.	Then?	0
Should I hit it?	Just give it a nice little tap.	0
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.	Pinching me!	0
Yes...	Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?	0
Jack...	Pro bono.  You donít get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...	0
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.	Let me see if it changes colors on me.	0
Thank you.	You're welcome.	0
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.	You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.	0
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.	Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.	0
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?	I got into a little crap game.	0
With what?	Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.	0
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?	Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?	0
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.	0
Why not? I need to get in there!	In the casino.	0
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."	We'll let it run awhile	0
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!	I can't stay here.	0
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.	No... they won't kill me.	0
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.	Because you can barely walk.	0
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.	Please, be quiet.	0
They're waiting for him to walk in.	Let's find out.	0
Your i --	Hmm.	0
What is that?	Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?	0
Homey.	Ma...	0
You may.	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.	0
Sonofabitch!	Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.	0
I shouldn't have asked you to come.	How did you...?	0
You're going?	You're going.	0
I had to see you.	What's up?	0
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.	That what he says. Right?	0
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --	No, hey, I like your coat --	0
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.	Have you ever known me not to be.	0
What?	I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!	0
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.	Don't go.	0
No, I'm fine.	It is that simple.	0
I just want to know where he is.	As far as I know, he went back to his parents.	0
-- instead of what he is --	What I am.	0
Yeah.	You bit my finger.	0
My husband can't know about this.	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?	0
Do you?	All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?	0
How do you like my dress?	About the baby.	0
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.	You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.	0
The final act? Well let's play asshole!	No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.	0
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.	And what happens when you lose?	0
Musclehead?	He's missing.	0
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.	Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --	0
Good. We'll sell tickets.	Tickets to Malkovich?	0
I didn't know you cared.	We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!	0
About what?	Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.	0
What makes you think so?	I think I'd like a little company.	0
That's what you said before.	Moreover...	0
Know what?	That I didn't leave you there to rot.	0
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.	Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.	0
I love you, Chuck.	I guess you're right.	0
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...	I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.	0
Well I was born in St. Louis.	Do you want me to pet your head?	0
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.	You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.	0
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.	No. Thanks.	0
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.	Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.	0
How?	I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...	0
Sorry to wake you.	Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.	0
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?	What do you mean, next?	0
What?	Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.	0
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	No, sir, WHAT?	0
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.	He married you, didn't he?	0
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?	Why aren't you understanding?	0
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.	Good.	0
I'm fine.	How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.	0
Do you love me?	Sort of a trial balloon.	0
You better not, Jeffrey.	I don't think I could be.	0
Who?	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.	0
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --	If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!	0
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?	I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.	0
Have you any place in mind?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.	0
Is that one of the Who's Who?	No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--	0
What are you guys doin'?	Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".	0
That's great. I -- didn't know.	She saved my life.	0
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --	We already played that game. You lost, remember?	0
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.	Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -	0
Your kids never cry.	Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.	0
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.	What?	0
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?	Yes, ma'am?	0
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?	I'll make it up to you!	0
You and I -- a relationship.	We're out of a job.	0
Leave him alone!	Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.	0
What's he smoking?	I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...	0
What a nice place.	I've never seen the ocean, either.	0
What difference does it make?	A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.	0
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.	Why are there two deeds here?	0
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.	You took the time to pay the saleswoman.	0
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.	Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.	0
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.	He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.	0
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.	Did to.	0
You can't walk me home.	Why not ?	0
Jack, I think I should get a job.	Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....	0
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.	No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.	0
I might've been away for the weekend.	They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....	0
What's the matter with your leg?	You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.	0
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.	They make gypsies look good.	0
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.	But it's light in there now.	0
Train. It took eight hours.	I think I'm ready for the Show.	0
Huckleberry Hound?	No.	0
You know I love spaghetti.	Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.	0
Well, what time is it?	2004.	0
Goodnight.	Goodnight, Miss Wells.	0
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.	Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.	0
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.	See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!	0
It's an uprising.	Of birds?	0
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.	O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.	0
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youíd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youíre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?	I guess the news youíd sent me after Friedman didnít go down too well, eh?	0
Right back at the start, right?	Go down in my room.	0
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.	No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.	0
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?	You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?	0
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.	Who's "they"?	0
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?	Okay.	0
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?	That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.	0
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!	Oh Jesus.	0
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.	I'm sorry to hear that.	0
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.	Yes.	0
We're in the middle of a murder case --	Are you sorry she's dead?	0
You're implying th...	I said.  No further questions.	0
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.	Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.	0
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.	Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.	0
Our greenhouse.	I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.	0
You're my prisoner.	You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.	0
Curious.	Well, thank you, Mary.	0
What'd she sing?	People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.	0
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...	0
What do you think?	This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!	0
He's a good kid. A salesman.	On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?	0
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.	Four days ago.	0
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.	Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?	0
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.	Bingo.	0
Don't you ever stop?	No.	0
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.	I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.	0
You're just going to have to trust me.	Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.	0
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.	I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.	0
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.	I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.	0
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.	I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?	0
Is he there?	No, honey.  No, he's not here.	0
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.	0
The church.	Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...	0
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.	Uh-huh.	0
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...	Look up, sunshine	0
I don't mind waiting.	Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.	0
You all act like two roosters.	I'm not going to let him get away with murder.	0
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?	Sometimes I forget.	0
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?	I've lost my car.	0
The telephone is ringing.	Oh, let it ring.	0
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.	Right.  Here!  c-4.	0
Have you done this sort of thing before?	All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.	0
Yeah.	The pleasure is mine.	0
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.	Should I?	0
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.	Hey, what's up.	0
Yes. Frank--	I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.	0
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...	You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.	0
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.	So?	0
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.	Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.	0
You were made for this.	Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.	0
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."	They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?	0
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.	Take your time.	0
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.	Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!	0
I'm so cold.	Why, I needed aó	0
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.	Shhh... don't talk.	0
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?	Well...	0
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.	Yeah.	0
Scott, You can't save everyone.	I've proved that, didn't I?	0
I already explained about that.	That last Martini.	0
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.	I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.	0
And what am I?	I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.	0
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.	Why not?	0
You keep asking me why I'm here.	Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.	0
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.	You're society girls?	0
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?	Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --	0
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....	Good.	0
That's your dog.	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.	0
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?	No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.	0
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.	Oh, be still my heart.	0
I'm coming in.	I don't want you to!	0
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.	Yeah --	0
I'm tired of living on the fringe.	But you used to say --	0
Dwayne -	What it was like.	0
Mr. Henslowe?	Let him be damned for his pages!	0
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --	No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.	0
We know all that we need to know --	But there's so much to tell you --	0
Did you say something?	No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?	0
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.	She was willing to lick the stamps.	0
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!	A wonderful idea! Radio or records?	0
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.	Linda --	0
It won't sell.	My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.	0
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.	A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.	0
But...	Pull over.	0
Why did he tell you?	What did it say?	0
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--	0
We searched the house.	There's nothing to be sorry about.	0
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...	Is he going to be okay?	0
Thank heaven that's over!	I have a feeling we've just begun.	0
Ellen.	Just regulation size.  We have three like this.	0
We seem to say goodnight a lot.	We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...	0
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.	It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.	0
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.	My darling.	0
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?	You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.	0
They do not have your connections.	I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?	0
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.	That's it? That's what you're giving me?	0
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?	Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.	0
If it's any of your business, yes.	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.	0
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?	You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.	0
Don't mention it.	Yes I do.	0
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.	That's frustrating.	0
Are you wasted?	No. I just got a messed up stomach.	0
Sugar?	Yes, one and a half please.	0
Oh my God!	...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.	0
This is ridiculous!	Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!	0
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...	Yes.	0
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.	Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!	0
We're supposed to go to the lake.	I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.	0
They must work on the section gang.	She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...	0
I didn't?	Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...	0
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.	Sure.	0
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --	Are we in Brooklyn?	0
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.	0
You don't think so?	Look, I'm entering the draft.	0
Do you? Oh do you, darling?	Why certainly!	0
It's your best play, Nicky.	They'll lose because they're my team.	0
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?	It's possible.	0
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.	See you.	0
Well, I want you to leave.	But why, Claudia?... Why?	0
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...	Rath.  Robert Rath.	0
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.	Would you step outside, Sergeant?	0
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.	You paid $50,000 for your character?	0
You don't look it.	No. Really, I am.	0
Who told you that?	He video taped you.	0
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.	0
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.	You talking to me?	0
What are you doing?	Sure.	0
Come up and see me... now.	Just check out the car.	0
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.	You were?	0
I'm curious about you.	Why?	0
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.	My mom wasn't a goat?	0
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?	Now what do you want to talk about?	0
That's right.	Did his parents attend to that?	0
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.	You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...	0
...I do.	Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.	0
Paranoiac!	I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!	0
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.	I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.	0
Panes is here!	Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?	0
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?	Don't worry!	0
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.	Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.	0
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.	Really, Sara, I...	0
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.	That was in jest.	0
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?	xxxxxx	0
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--	I can't blame the ocean--it's you.	0
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.	Starla, it ain't --	0
More confident, maybe.	Harder.	0
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!	Well -- my wife got this new job...	0
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.	Harry.	0
Here...use a spoon.	Leave me alone, Marion.	0
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.	They could be.	0
No, sir--	Yeah. But enough about me.	0
Sorry.	How was the beach?	0
You can't use that until Neo is out!	I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.	0
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.	I touched a nerve.	0
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...	Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.	0
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.	Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"	0
We gotta get you to a doctor.	So what?	0
No... Could you?	No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.	0
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?	Whatever.	0
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.	Okay, but that doesn't excuse his ñ	0
What?	Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.	0
You would.	Okey-doke.	0
How was lunch?	Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?	0
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...	That is not true. They have tried to help me.	0
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.	We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?	0
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.	So, where's "Weird Al"?	0
Youíre mad...	Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?	0
Oh, good. Okay.	By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.	0
Where what was.	Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.	0
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.	Uh... sure... come in.	0
No I'm not.	You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?	0
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?	Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?	0
Gus, have you ever been in love?	Leave.	0
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I can imagine.	0
Neat...	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.	0
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.	Right...	0
No.	Yeah, I'll do you a favour.	0
What the hell is going on?	Pool on the roof must have a leak.	0
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.	Hi.	0
...Don't get all...	...like it never even happened...	0
Don't take anything.	I'll try.	0
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.	0
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!	That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --	0
No!	Yes!	0
What line is he in.	Yes you can, Robin.	0
Here we go.	They had all the pieces they needed.	0
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.	Uh, if the guy wants to.	0
How much?	That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.	0
Long enough.	"For"...?	0
What's the matter?	Yes...	0
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --	Maybe I could try --	0
I know, Dad.  I love you too.	Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?	0
Mm, you want to steal it?	No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.	0
I want to fuck.	I am.  Are you a climber?	0
They're all your enemies?	Last night? What do you mean?	0
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.	Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.	0
Well, personally, I never went for church names.	And where do you think Jezebel comes from?	0
Yeah.  Thanks to you.	And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.	0
Better times.	Now wait a minute --	0
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--	Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.	0
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?	Nothing.	0
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.	I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?	0
All right. Now let's get to bed.	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?	0
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.	0
How's it going?	Yeah.  One, two, three...	0
Okay, til tonight.	Tonight.	0
Nobody. I love you, remember?	Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?	0
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.	It's valuable.  Hang onto it.	0
I guess so.	Well, you didn't marry her.	0
What do we do?	Mary . . .	0
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.	You have a job?	0
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.	Why?	0
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.	What about Sing?	0
Patience my love, patience.	After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.	0
Don't talk like that to him!	Very serious?	0
Oh --	All hollow.  Oh --	0
I sing now?	That's the premise.	0
My sympathies.	I don't know - a sharp pain.	0
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.	But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...	0
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?	Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.	0
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"	They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.	0
Brady! Come with us! Brady!	Go!	0
What are you doing... ?	Very nice.	0
Don't sit down.	So you won't help me?	0
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.	Come back to me.	0
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?	0
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.	You like baseball?	0
You still care about me?	I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.	0
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?	No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.	0
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.	I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?	0
But I told her to go with you.	Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!	0
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?	Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.	0
A friend dropped me off.	What?	0
Where are we, mean man?	Must of made quite an impression.	0
They were very upset.	Would you describe their position as inflexible?	0
I'm in love with Lloyd!	Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-	0
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.	Fair enough.	0
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?	I confess.	0
Yes.	Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.	0
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...	Shu Lien...	0
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.	It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.	0
You two need a time-out.	Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?	0
About me?	...Not the bat?	0
Maybe you don't even like children.	Of course I like children.	0
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.	Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.	0
Darling!	You're insane or you think I am.	0
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.	Because I...want...to...fit...in.	0
That's Montana over there.	I had to quit, Midge.	0
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...	Gambling's not about money.	0
So?	Okay, Sandy.	0
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.	I'm so glad we're having this chat.	0
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.	Really big bed.	0
How long before this car's hot?	Pull over.	0
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.	Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.	0
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.	He taught all this to Swann?	0
Yes?	Order me a pastrami for after?	0
What'd he say?	Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?	0
Not like He punished me.	Where's your bike?	0
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.	0
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.	Pretty sure.	0
Who do you think did it?	Mimi...	0
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?	I'm starving.	0
So you never knew your mother?	Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.	0
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?	Elaine, we have to go back.	0
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --	Nothing.	0
Really? Did you play in a band?	Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.	0
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.	But then you've been so much better...	0
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?	Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.	0
There are caves in those mountains.	We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...	0
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...	It's just impossible.	0
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.	Thanks.	0
What about you, Buddy?	Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.	0
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.	A surgeon might...	0
It's so... small.	Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.	0
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --	-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.	0
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.	I sure hope so.	0
How will he do that?	Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.	0
I think so.	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.	0
You are too crude.	Thanks.	0
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.	That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.	0
Why?	You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.	0
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.	You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?	0
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --	But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.	0
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.	I'm sorry to see you go.	0
So you haven't heard this record yet?	No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.	0
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.	And Tracy's on the move ...	0
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.	I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.	0
I don't want to take you out of your way.	It's okay.	0
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...	How?	0
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.	0
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.	0
Do you have any pictures if her?	Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.	0
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.	0
How are you holding up?	Nothing.	0
Oh God, Sailor.	Will you marry me?	0
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.	It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!	0
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...	I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.	0
Yes he did.	Where is he?	0
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.	I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.	0
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.	I'll always go back to that church.	0
Change my name.	You're... quitting?	0
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.	So what's your story?	0
Larry!	I hear you.	0
My kid brother has one.  You know why?	Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.	0
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.	Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!	0
I don't believe it.	I swear to you, it's true...	0
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.	She's dead.	0
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.	Charlie -	0
Really?	Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.	0
Why?	Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?	0
Do you always open quickly?	No, he didn't.	0
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.	All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.	0
Sounds risky to me.	You getting cold feet?	0
What makes you think there might be?	No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."	0
Is that better?	Things a man isn't supposed to know.	0
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?	0
Do you believe me?	I don't know.	0
Oh, of course. What is your name?	Harold Chasen.	0
The sign of our partnership.	I like her.	0
You think you are... .	They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.	0
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.	You're serious?	0
But she's not dead, Wes.	You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!	0
My name is Trinity.	Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?	0
Were any of them married?	Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.	0
You certain?	I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.	0
Really?	Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?	0
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.	Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.	0
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.	All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.	0
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?	Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.	0
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?	Tonight?	0
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.	There there...	0
Joe, I can't look at you any more.	Nobody asked you to.	0
Are you sure you saw something?	Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?	0
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?	Don't move.	0
Oh, uh-huh.	Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --	0
Yesterday. It all looked normal.	Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.	0
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...	You mean you could use it.	0
You see what you're doing, don't you?	I don't know who that is.	0
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.	It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...	0
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.	God, you... you're mean.	0
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.	0
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.	What word would you use, Elaine?	0
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.	No again?	0
You said things would be fine, and they're not.	Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.	0
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!	Of course, my dear. What can I do?	0
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?	Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --	0
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?	Months, Swana.	0
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.	Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?	0
If you did, you never showed it.	Ronnie...	0
Keys.	What is wrong with me?	0
Wynant's body?	Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?	0
We've got pressure.	Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.	0
They've got my Amado.	Got him here?	0
Any minute I want!	You're conceited--	0
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...	Yes! I've only seen one, though.	0
Tired...	I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...	0
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!	I will not defend my life to you--	0
That's the way he is.	She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!	0
You're just jealous.	I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.	0
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.	What's that supposed to mean?	0
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?	Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --	0
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.	Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?	0
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.	Maybe he didn't like us.	0
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?	What John Doe?	0
I'm sorry.	For what? A couple hundred bucks?	0
Hiding?	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.	0
What?	Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.	0
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.	I'm telling you he won't know the difference.	0
What would you do?	We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.	0
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?	I don't know.	0
We get the Mask I'll tell you.	Do you follow or should I speak slower?	0
He went off someplace.	Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.	0
Yeah, if it opens the door.	Yeah.	0
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.	My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?	0
You can touch me, I won't bite.	Not too sure about that.	0
Drive through it!	Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?	0
Please.	Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.	0
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?	The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.	0
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....	There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....	0
Do you?	I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....	0
You give me a pain!	Stay!	0
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?	No...	0
She ever pull down her shades?	That what he says. Right?	0
Sorry. Iím a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.	This happened to you?	0
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.	Just regulation size.  We have three like this.	0
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!	0
She's not in an ambulance Father.	Why not?	0
It's late....	Trying to write our report....	0
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?	What?	0
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?	Yeah -- but can she cook?	0
Did you need something?	Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.	0
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?	Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.	0
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.	Close!  The <u>other</u> one!	0
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.	What was your deal with Job?	0
Which one is yours - the big one?	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.	0
Thank you.	Don't be late.	0
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!	Let us go, miss.	0
When did you two talk this over?	Do you miss it?	0
You said you couldn't kill anybody.	We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.	0
Faster, faster!	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!	0
I won.	How did it end?	0
You wish.	What?	0
Brady!	Get back!	0
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.	What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?	0
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!	I thought he was a kind, gentle man?	0
Why did you lie to me?	Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.	0
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.	0
3:30 I guess.	Give or take a year.	0
No, I like him.	I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...	0
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.	Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.	0
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.	All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!	0
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?	Yes.	0
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.	Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.	0
and I keep, you know, it's-	How are you?	0
You were attracted to me?	I disagree.	0
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.	What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?	0
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.	Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.	0
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.	No way.	0
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -	Allo?	0
Better keep moving....	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?	0
Does that scare you?	Yes, one and a half please.	0
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...	Habit, mostly, just like this.	0
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.	Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.	0
How do you know about Dr. Becker?	I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.	0
How would you know?	Hey, two days with him is enough.	0
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!	I said back away.	0
You feel it?  It's different this time.	We're actually inside, aren't we?	0
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.	That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?	0
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --	It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.	0
What a nice place.	Yeah, the tree makes it nice.	0
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?	"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?	0
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.	You just did, for Christ sake.	0
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...	I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]	0
Oh, ha, ha, ha.	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!	0
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.	Come here, sit down over here.	0
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -	You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --	0
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?	Sounds like a special guy.	0
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--	0
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.	...why?	0
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.	I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...	0
Next time, page me first.	Okay.	0
The tap. What you do for a living.	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.	0
I don't think so.	I wish you'd make sure.	0
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.	I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?	0
How long has he been dead?	I could stay and go.	0
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.	He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.	0
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.	Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.	0
Looks old.	Older than me.	0
What?	Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.	0
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.	That's what we want to find out.	0
No.	It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?	0
Let's try a little harder, shall we?	Good! Snipers can't be in position.	0
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?	It's Webber.  Adam Webber.	0
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.	0
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?	It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?	0
What?	What are you looking at?	0
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.	I love you, Jez.	0
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?	This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.	0
Yeah.	Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?	0
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.	Will Shakespeare!	0
No.	Where?	0
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.	Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.	0
Oh. So what's it doing here?	They want me to do things for them.	0
Have you finished?	When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womanís intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?	0
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?	Yeah.  Me, too.	0
He knows that?  Billy?	Yes.  He does.	0
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.	Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...	0
-- just to clarify --	I don't even know if you're my girl.	0
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.	Now you and David...	0
You weren't disappointed in her, then.	In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.	0
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!	I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.	0
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.	0
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.	I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.	0
Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.	0
Chances of recovery?	Carlos De Moraes?	0
Together.	Then a little nap--	0
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.	Your brother...	0
Yes.	You think I have a problem?	0
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.	Then you won't forgive me?	0
I don't care, Dad. I love you.	Can we watch the monster movies?	0
...Fine.	Me, I'm kinda aggravated.	0
...I'm sorry.	Fiendishly so.	0
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?	Not yet.	0
Is there a part for me?	Why not?	0
Well... kind of, sort of?	Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?	0
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.	You leave something out?	0
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.	Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.	0
Can it be destroyed?	Yeah?	0
Did you find it boring?	So you slept O.K.?	0
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.	Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....	0
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.	That's right.	0
So...what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.	0
You should be dead.  How do you feel?	Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?	0
...Why don't I just type this up...	Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.	0
How much does it cost?	Thirty five dollars.	0
Well you tried --	I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...	0
I have to.	Can we split now?	0
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.	Uh-huh.	0
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?	Yes?	0
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --	Not you too	0
A lot's happened since last weekend.	You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...	0
Let's keep it to business, shall we?	Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?	0
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.	I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?	0
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.	Do you have something to drink?	0
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?	Oh... I have some questions.	0
I'll call an ambulance.	Shhh!	0
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell meó who?  -- who?	I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.	0
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.	They know you are Tutsi!	0
Oh.	There has to be something that we can do.	0
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...	A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?	0
Not much, I think.	I'm just like him.	0
How can you do that if she's already off the line?	I can sit through it once.	0
My lord.	I have spoken with your father.	0
You son of a bitch.	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.	0
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.	Will that be on the midterm?	0
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.	0
Ian's a very good friend of mine.	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.	0
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.	Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!	0
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.	We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.	0
My mother stood on this very spot.	I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.	0
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.	We don't have time to argue about it!	0
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...	I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.	0
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.	Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.	0
I'm so sorry.	It's all right.	0
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?	Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.	0
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things	Wait a minute!	0
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.	I am one of those guys.	0
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --	Who buys them? Tax collectors?	0
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...	Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...	0
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.	What if I come back?	0
A man might what?	Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.	0
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?	I'm going to take Asta for a walk.	0
You sure?	No, I got time.	0
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.	Well I guess that makes us even.	0
How much?	Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?	0
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.	Simple.	0
Then you know where Jacqueline is?	I can do that.	0
Power levels quite low, sir.	Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?	0
I want to get in.	You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?	0
Give me some credit, will you?	A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?	0
Was it Foley?	A lot of things fell apart up there.	0
I told you. I'm like positive.	This thing works. We could go home right now.	0
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?	Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.	0
Don't ever let go.	Sweetheart--	0
Monsieur Rick, I --	I'll call you, when you're on your way.	0
Why not?	Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.	0
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.	Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?	0
Who told you that?	What happened to your eye ?	0
He had his hand on her titty.	Let me look.  Aww-rr...	0
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!	No.	0
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?	Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.	0
That's what you want, isn't it?	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.	0
Can I ask you something?	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?	0
Something like that.	And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.	0
...Fine.	I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?	0
At what intervals does he whistle?	What?	0
Are you staying with a friend, sir?	No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.	0
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.	Hm.	0
...Iím Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thatís who I am. Do you get what Iím fucking saying, Mr Lombard?	Sh!	0
So whose route is this?	Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.	0
I wouldn't have let you.	Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?	0
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.	I do not remember them. I was one or two.	0
...peanuts.	Pretty soon I'll be making a move.	0
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.	Let me have it.	0
That's a lie!  They still want me!	I don't think you do.	0
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.	then we should...	0
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!	I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.	0
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.	Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?	0
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....	That's a good idea.	0
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?	How many men since then?	0
You wanna make a deal with me?	An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.	0
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.	I'm not.	0
What was that?	Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.	0
You're not going to notify my father, are you?	What for?	0
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.	He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!	0
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...	Claire, please...	0
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --	Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --	0
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?	It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.	0
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	In 76 years, me neither.	0
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.	That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.	0
Like you could find one	Cute?	0
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?	Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.	0
That was lovely!	It's only a tale.	0
I don't know.  I'm all right.	Really?  You sure?	0
No dances, just tell me.	The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...	0
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.	No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?	0
Is it intelligent?	Intelligent beyond our comprehension.	0
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?	Oh, terrific. Which way?	0
What's so important?	I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.	0
Are you serious?	Not ever?	0
What's your problem?	Nothing.	0
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.	0
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--	Smoke screen for what?	0
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.	Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?	0
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.	Yes mam...	0
You never cared before.	I don't believe he did it.	0
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.	0
Where to?	Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.	0
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.	I've got something in my bag.	0
Yes.	You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?	0
Great!  What is it?	It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.	0
There's a different between want and	That's why you come back, huh?	0
Beloved husband...	Beloved wife...	0
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --	My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --	0
So why isn't it all bloody?	I assume he licked it clean.	0
No! At least I don't think I am!	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?	0
We'll see about that.	I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.	0
Me?  Why me?	Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?	0
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?	They revoke our flight status.	0
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?	Are we in Brooklyn?	0
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...	Who is Pamela Landy?	0
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.	He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?	0
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!	Your Majesty --	0
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.	Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--	0
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.	Why?	0
Oh, yeah, really, oh!	Do you remember what we talked about?	0
Does it work?	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.	0
A merger?  How long will you be gone?	Ram it up your ass!	0
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.	Now...I donít...	0
I love you Don with all my heart.	I've got something better.	0
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.	Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.	0
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.	I know what you mean.	0
I get it!	You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.	0
Can we look at one?	I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.	0
Better person than I.	See!	0
So, whatís your point?	Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.	0
Why?... Why would you need me?	I'm thinking Dorsia.	0
Why don't you back off?	Yeah, I think so.	0
It's so--so stark.	You used to like it stark!	0
Yes?	I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.	0
Don't tell me you're a believer now?	Why don't you open it and find out?	0
You won't believe me.	xxxxxx	0
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...	...A flaw...	0
Okay.	You and me.	0
What are you thinking about?	By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.	0
Pointing upwards Look...	Did you ahh, love him?	0
Committed?	Committed.	0
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?	If you'll just listen to me for a minute --	0
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!	Can't you please just talk to me for one second?	0
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?	Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.	0
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?	Do me one favor óó if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.	0
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.	What about Job?	0
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...	You know I want to...	0
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?	Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.	0
Latitude 47 degrees.	Wait a second. He knows I know.	0
What?  What are you talking about?	There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.	0
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.	Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...	0
That's probably a good idea.	All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.	0
Me, too. And very erotic...	Two weeks.	0
He's coming?	Can you move over a wee bit?	0
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.	Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.	0
Thank-you.	I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.	0
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?	0
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.	I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.	0
What about sex?	Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.	0
The forager's back.	Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.	0
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.	You need to sober up.	0
I have someone I want you to meet.	I did more then that.	0
...There's a start for a meeting.	No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.	0
What?	He says it's a bad idea!	0
Why?	Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...	0
You're kidding. When for?	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.	0
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?	0
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy	and thus unable to declare her love	0
Did I say that?	Of course you did.	0
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.	You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.	0
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.	I'm trying to buy you a suit.	0
Yeah?	It's terrific.	0
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?	I'm talking about you. And what you want.	0
Annie made them.	Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?	0
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...	I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.	0
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.	It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.	0
Shut the fuck up.	Good thinking.  What's all this?	0
What if he can't?	I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.	0
What're you doing?	Did you hear what he sang?	0
What?	Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.	0
No I Said.	Ok. What's your name?	0
I am not like my mother!	You are.	0
OK.	Well what?	0
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.	I would have done the same thing.	0
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.	I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.	0
I'm going to my mother's.	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.	0
And you think the movie business is any different?	Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.	0
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.	Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.	0
Hi. Hi, hi.	His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling...	0
Wolfi!	Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.	0
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?	No, tell me.	0
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.	You had breakfast yet, Margie?	0
Hi.	Well, maybe you're right.	0
Smells like dirt.	They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.	0
I meanÖYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can	Lady Viola isÖyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.	0
You're a family man, Frankie?	Yes mam...	0
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.	Yeah, like what?	0
I thought I was helping you.	I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?	0
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.	What did they want to know?	0
I can't take this anymore.	No.	0
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?	I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.	0
Gabe!  Are you alright?	How do you figure?	0
Little bit.	Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.	0
God, Spiderman looks different.	Is something wrong?	0
Try holding the match like this.	This is gotta be a game, right?	0
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.	This is absurd.	0
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.	0
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....	I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...	0
In your car	Why not.	0
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.	0
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!	No, you don't understand. Your daughter-	0
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.	Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?	0
Are you staying at the hotel?	Murder!	0
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.	0
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!	Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.	0
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...	The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.	0
Martin, it's not funny!	You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.	0
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.	I put in for a replacement for you but no one...	0
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.	Where'd you grow up?	0
Why later?	I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.	0
Excuse me?	You don't say!	0
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?	0
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.	How'd you find that out?	0
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."	Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?	0
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!	Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.	0
I don't anymore.	Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.	0
Here you go.	No, thank you.  Goodnight.	0
Why?	Well I don't want to do something like that.	0
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.	We never really shared one.	0
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.	How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.	0
They could try to tranq him on land.	They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.	0
Pig died.	Who the fuck's Pig?	0
Where are we going?	Someplace safe.	0
So wadda you do with your girls?	Thank you for volunteering.	0
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.	I love you, Elaine.	0
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.	Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.	0
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?	Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.	0
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?	What taxi driver?	0
What, are you trying to get rid of me?	No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --	0
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?	Never before this.	0
And you honestly think that's what she meant?	Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.	0
Sorry.	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.	0
For what?	He's not a moron.	0
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.	Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?	0
Mr. Kay, sir.	Yes?	0
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?	They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.	0
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.	All right. What's been going on?	0
What are you doing in there?	Have it your way... But you want it.	0
Yeah.	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.	0
You been drinkin', huh?	Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?	0
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.	Oh?	0
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.	Well, we were just...	0
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?	No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?	0
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?	And your gun.	0
What?	Did you have a nice time?	0
Is she coming back?	No.	0
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.	No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.	0
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?	Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.	0
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?	Huh?	0
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.	Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.	0
Besides that.	Excuse me?	0
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...	Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.	0
Just don't tell Lydia.	Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.	0
Thank you, Baron.	Yah, is this Marge?	0
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.	Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.	0
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!	Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...	0
Mulholland Drive.	Figures.	0
Not exactly.	Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!	0
What'd ya see?	Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.	0
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.	What are they doing, Doll?	0
This has nothing to do with you.	Sure.	0
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.	0
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.	I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...	0
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?	You do?	0
-- what...are...you...going...to --	I guess they're stupid.	0
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.	I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.	0
Thereíve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, itís just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.	0
I don't know what that means.	A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.	0
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.	Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.	0
Havana.	Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...	0
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...	Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.	0
We've got pressure.	It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.	0
Who was the other man?	I don't know.	0
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?	Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.	0
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.	Gee, that's great.	0
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.	I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.	0
Okay.	Come on...	0
This is just... so...	Maybe you want to go.	0
Ed --	Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.	0
Uh-huh.	You don't still think it was me?	0
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.	It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.	0
I still am.	Is that right?	0
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.	Okay. Recommended...	0
Oh... Well.	The car broke down.	0
It's not -- what's a 422?	--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.	0
That is so--weird that you name your car.	All the words you've got.	0
Is that a request or a command?	You know what I mean	0
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.	Tell me about Catherine.	0
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?	Dickie did it.	0
I havenít been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.	Okay.	0
Why not?	If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.	0
Are you sure you parked it there?	The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?	0
Yes.	Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...	0
Uh, what are those boxes?	For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.	0
Can we turn back?	Sometime, but not like this.	0
Did I kill my mother?	Augh?	0
But wishes don't come true.	So what are you saying?	0
So how did it know my name, then?	But you don't hate him.	0
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.	Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.	0
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?	You can sleep tomorrow... come on...	0
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.	Aw, Baby.	0
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.	0
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?	I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.	0
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.	Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?	0
What are you talking about?	Why does anyone want to be in movies?	0
Right back at the start, right?	The opera.	0
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.	0
I got it all ready. Here.	I didn't know this would happen.	0
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!	Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?	0
I'm...all right.	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.	0
Who?	...What do you mean?	0
You mean - like frigid?	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.	0
Where do we go?	My house.  I want to try something.	0
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?	No. No, ma'am.	0
Guess!	And you like it.	0
Where?	We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.	0
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.	IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!	0
Yes, sir.	...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.	0
We are the choices we've made, Robert.	Really?	0
Brady!	No. You son of a bitch!	0
Evelyn Waugh?	What?	0
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.	Look. You don't know good. All right?	0
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...	Nothin'...	0
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.	I miss her. I miss my wife.	0
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.	What?	0
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.	...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.	0
You must've had a reason to ask me that.	No. I'm just a snoop.	0
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?	D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?	0
Yes.	See you tomorrow.	0
What are we playing for?	Clothes.	0
You're up!  You must be feeling better --	Yes...	0
You saw a lot in one night.	Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.	0
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.	During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.	0
Will you take me with you?	I mean if you didn't know who I was.	0
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.	Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."	0
Are you here?	I'm here.	0
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.	I did more then that.	0
What?	Good...	0
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.	And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?	0
What kind of a horrible thing is that?	It still worked in town.	0
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?	Goodnight.	0
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?	Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.	0
Had?	That's enough, Ellen.	0
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.	No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.	0
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youíve seen my pay check.	Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.	0
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --	-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---	0
Is that what you call it? "Real"?	Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.	0
I deserve better than this.	Do you really mean it this time Gale?	0
Why you got me chained?	What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?	0
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.	Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?	0
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...	We're gonna try.	0
Have you got a minute?	Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?	0
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?	I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.	0
Yes I am.	He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.	0
Hey look, it's Sausalito.	You are married, correct?	0
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...	Can we make out now?	0
Max?	Seven.	0
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.	No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.	0
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?	Isn't therapy helping at all?	0
Oh, I thought I saw you.	You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?	0
Then you don't want me to go there.	Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.	0
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.	Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.	0
I do not love you, my lord.	How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.	0
Come with me to California.	What?	0
Sure you don't want to come with me?	Must of made quite an impression.	0
For Pete's sake, Norville!	Of course you do.	0
Don't puss out.	That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.	0
So I hear. Is that all?	No, that's not all.	0
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.	It's pretty exciting.	0
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.	0
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.	Shut up! Shut up!	0
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--	0
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.	Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--	0
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.	But I'm curious, Rose.	0
I've gotta go in.	I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.	0
What's it mean?	Oh, Laura.	0
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.	Yes, I knowÖBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.	0
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...	Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.	0
Why?	Last year? It can't be that long.	0
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?	People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.	0
How bad off is he?	I can look and see.	0
I'm glad you think so.	There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".	0
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!	Remember he's left-handed.	0
You're getting off the grift?	That's right.	0
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.	If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?	0
Did you feel anything?	Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?	0
Thank you.	It's all right.	0
No.	What are you drinking?	0
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...	You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!	0
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.	He's a selfish bastard.	0
You were a soldier, were you?	Once.	0
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?	That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.	0
I enjoy his company....	I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....	0
There's little chicks!  You want to see?	I've got more. You better tell me.	0
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.	We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.	0
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.	Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.	0
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.	--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?	0
Does it happen to all men?	He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...	0
Where are you going?!	He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.	0
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?	Because I'd like to have dinner with you.	0
Jake...	Do what I say.	0
He said that my hand felt good.	Then what happened?	0
Frank!	Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.	0
Leon! What in heaven's name...!	Huh?	0
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,	You said it!	0
Who from work?	Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?	0
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?	Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.	0
And am I not fair?	That's no way to talk...	0
Mrs. Thorwald?	Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.	0
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?	Must be my wife.	0
When did you start smoking?	I don't smoke?	0
Are we under arrest?	Your insight is enlightening.	0
Go!	I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --	0
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.	Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?	0
Yeah.	Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?	0
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.	She expects me to marry her.	0
Let me go now, you'll make me late.	Do me an enormous favor?	0
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.	I don't know.	0
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.	I'll see what's going on.	0
Dead?	A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.	0
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --	I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.	0
Do you want to sleep on it?	No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?	0
Okay. Yeah. What time?	Eight?	0
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.	I might not be able to.	0
Sir?	Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?	0
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.	Incredible similarity.	0
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?	Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...	0
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!	You like her?	0
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.	Everybody else does. Why not you?	0
You're soaking.	Mmnn.	0
What about that girl?	I know you do, so that's why --	0
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?	I think that'll be fine.	0
Well, that's that.	That's it.	0
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.	Yes... leaving immediately.	0
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.	He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?	0
What about the wedding?	Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....	0
Who are you going to call?	... I see.	0
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.	Iíll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.	0
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...	Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...	0
I never thought you did.	No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!	0
Thank you.	How about it?	0
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.	The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.	0
Did we want to?	You been to Japan?	0
What are you doing here?	Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.	0
Yes.	Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.	0
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?	I don't want you to forgive me.	0
He killed them?	Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --	0
How do you know that?	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.	0
I'm never going back.	I know what I see.	0
Meaning...	--I got a trip to Mars.	0
I fantasized about you.	About me?	0
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!	You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.	0
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...	Do you really think so?	0
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.	Even when you say the things, there's always more things.	0
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.	All right.  She smiles back.	0
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.	How did they threaten you?	0
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!	Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.	0
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?	Well I ain't one of 'em!	0
What are you doing?	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.	0
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.	See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?	0
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.	0
Jesus...	-- Yeah... your car down here?	0
Well, these things take time.	I was parked in day parking.	0
Never did catch your name.	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.	0
You've got it all figured.	I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...	0
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.	There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.	0
Coffee?	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.	0
Well, we need that ring.	Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.	0
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.	Well... I guess so.	0
You never have dessert.	Why, you like the duck with the cigar?	0
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.	I'm sorry, I can't.	0
No... Why?... Should I?	A girl after your own heart, Ted.	0
Do you really not believe in God?	It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...	0
We are. And it's winding down.	But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.	0
-- to be put in that kind of position...	Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.	0
It would be a nice change from you.	25 kilos each, huh?	0
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...	It was different...	0
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?	I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.	0
He's good, isn't he?	Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...	0
But the million bucks each, that's for real?	Jean-I'm not-	0
The clock's already ticking.	Right, then...	0
Honey.  You got him.	I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.	0
I'd better get back now.	You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?	0
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.	Yes... I guess I knew that.	0
Well?	Great.	0
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--	This is the Feur thing?	0
Dad.  Do you believe me?	Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --	0
Hello?	Does it make you happy?	0
What are those?	What?	0
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.	I understand of course. It is to be expected.	0
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!	Dickhead?	0
He'll kill us.	I'm promised to another!	0
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.	Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.	0
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.	That what you do?	0
Michael, you're not going down there.	Must've been a cheap date.	0
Crafts.	We are...	0
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.	You do?	0
What?...WHAT!?	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.	0
Alright.	Alright. Meet me at the Met.	0
What!?!	Try to pay attention.	0
Who's keeping an eye on you?	The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...	0
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!	Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?	0
This is cheery.	Who is this guy, anyway?	0
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.	0
You're not a film producer, are you?	We don't have time to argue about it!	0
My God... Cal. Is it a --	Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.	0
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...	I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?	0
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.	I don't know - a sharp pain.	0
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.	Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.	0
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?	She's worried about the cow now.	0
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.	No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.	0
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?	Hello.	0
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -	You don't say?	0
You're not going to take your *suit* off!	What?	0
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?	Absolutely positively.	0
Don't make conversation with me.	What?	0
Doing what?	You want me drunk?	0
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?	None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.	0
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.	I know what it is.	0
Good call.	You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.	0
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.	So whatís with the nickname?	0
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.	Your insight is enlightening.	0
Where's Positano?	He told you.	0
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?	Yes, I am, Norma.	0
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?	Lint?	0
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.	True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.	0
Looks great.  It does.	You okay?  You seem a little off.	0
I have friends.	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?	0
Not really.	You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.	0
If you did, you never showed it.	Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.	0
You don't have to prove anything.	Only to myself.	0
Thank you.	Hi.	0
No.	Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?	0
Yes, darling?	Is your Evian spiked?	0
He's a very sweet man.	Where are you going now?	0
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.	I bet you do!	0
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.	Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.	0
What's that supposed to mean?	Think about it.	0
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...	Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"	0
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...	Okay, baby. Okay...	0
Remain calm.	Hello, Eve.	0
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...	What?	0
You've got to be kidding.	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.	0
You're not very ambitious, are you?	Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.	0
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.	That when you stopped being a nurse?	0
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.	That's good. I like to watch, too.	0
Thing?	Forget it.	0
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?	That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.	0
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.	0
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.	Will you come here?	0
Oh God, this is so weird.	Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.	0
To freedom.	To the Black Pearl.	0
Out.	Come on.	0
No.	Fine.  Have them do some.	0
Yeah.	You're with me now.	0
Thank you.	Where are you going?	0
Yeah...	Gotcha.	0
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.	Of course.	0
That's not what I meant.	It's exactly what you meant.	0
You blaming me for the traffic?	Should I?	0
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.	Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?	0
So the chest is still out there somewhere.	What? Steady like?	0
He's dead, huh?	Yes.	0
Ohhh --	What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.	0
Are you nervous, Walter?	Some committee's got it.	0
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?	It won't. Are you ready?	0
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.	Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.	0
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!	Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --	0
It's Charlie!	It's all yours, baby.	0
I don't really feel like talking anymore.	We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.	0
He'll need clothes... some money...	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.	0
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?	0
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.	It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.	0
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?	It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.	0
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?	No.	0
Yes, you can.	I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!	0
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...	You just expect me to whip something off, that it?	0
We don't both have to die.	I couldn't do it. Not to you.	0
No wonder--without your dinner.	Yeah?	0
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.	Being back here. Gives me the willies.	0
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!	Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?	0
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.	So, who'd you go to lunch with?	0
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.	Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."	0
Why?	Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.	0
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.	An angel?	0
Well, how'd you get here?	Just find him.	0
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.	Why not?	0
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --	Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.	0
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?	Awake? What do you mean?	0
Probably not.	Are you, are you out of work or something?	0
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.	Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.	0
Tell, tell, tell me again.	....we landing?	0
You're begging him to kill you?	It's so clean.  No germs.	0
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.	Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.	0
Really?	Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?	0
I have work....	I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.	0
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.	You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.	0
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.	That's temporary.	0
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.	I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.	0
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.	I can.  We can do this...	0
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...	Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.	0
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.	Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.	0
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!	The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.	0
To my triumph, of course.	Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...	0
A little longer, Paul?	We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.	0
What is with you tonight?	Don't I usually kiss my wife?	0
Six-fifty.	How can you be sure?	0
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.	I'm tired now.	0
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.	Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.	0
She was only teasin'.	Oh, sure.	0
Until it happens, you're still a human being.	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.	0
Get away from me.	Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?	0
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.	Well... I'll act like I do until I do.	0
Yes.	Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.	0
Friend of his. They play duets together.	Duets? But can we trust him?	0
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?	0
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.	He wants me to break a leg?	0
Perhaps it was a wrong number...	Yes, ma'am?	0
Probably not.	Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.	0
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.	Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.	0
John, get out of the way!!	Got yourself up?	0
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.	It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!	0
Caesar, this is crazy.	Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.	0
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.	What? What are you talking about?	0
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.	0
Graham...	I'm okay. It's okay.	0
Andy! Holy shit!	Serafine...?	0
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...	It's Barry.	0
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Itís no big deal. I promise.	Brilliant.	0
Yes.	Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?	0
It's all right.	Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.	0
That's past -- that's over and done with...	I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.	0
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.	I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.	0
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?	I'm not the one to ask...	0
Yeah.	That's a virtue isn't it?	0
We've only got one suit.	I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.	0
More.	Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.	0
I'm going to miss you.	That's what you said the other night.	0
I don't recall.	How many lovers have you had-- permanently?	0
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.	You better go.	0
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?	Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?	0
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.	I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.	0
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.	Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?	0
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?	Sure.	0
Doing what?	Shhhh.	0
And you've got cold feet.	Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...	0
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?	No, ma'am.	0
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.	You ever been to London?	0
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.	Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.	0
How close are you?	I don't know.	0
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.	You did?	0
Do you like talk like that?	No.	0
Are you asking me that?	Hi.  It's Frank.	0
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.	Isn't this technically a scooter?	0
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.	I'm getting to believe you.	0
I've been trying to find you all day.	What?	0
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.	I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.	0
What do we do now?	"American President"	0
You always want to run everything.	If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.	0
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.	Okay.	0
If this is a joke, it's not funny.	Love a cup of tea. With lemon.	0
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.	<u>What</u>?	0
We'll take the Royal Suite!	Two fifty-three, five--	0
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.	You'll think you're still at the convent.	0
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.	0
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.	How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?	0
What is it? A tranquilizer?	You need to know what?  Do I still love you?	0
You?! How about me?	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.	0
No. Except he smoked. Like you.	Me?	0
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?	No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.	0
Flip six, three hole.	What is?	0
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.	0
How do you suggest I go about it?	That's the premise.	0
Don't talk like that to him!	Get outta my life both of ya's.	0
Don't touch me. Or so help me --	What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.	0
Try Wednesday.	Right. Wednesday.	0
Do you have a boyfriend?	No. Do You?	0
SILENCE... SILENCE.	Why don't you try suicide?	0
I'll be ready.	Do you intend to stay here for some time?	0
Guess so.	48 hours.  Back before you know it.	0
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.	We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.	0
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.	Are yuh?	0
I had no idea you were even here.	I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.	0
Whoís she?	With all of it?	0
And go to confession.	How old are you?	0
What about Customs?	I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?	0
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe...	You want to read it?	0
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.	Tell them my house exploded.	0
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?	He was delightful.	0
At what?	You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.	0
What should I do?	No, more commercial stuff.	0
What're you doing?	What'd Ned say?	0
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.	Really.	0
...What?	I said you're bad.	0
Take care of yourself out there...	Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.	0
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.	You're lying --	0
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.	Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.	0
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?	I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.	0
A moonstone.	Your birth stone.  I thought --	0
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?	It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.	0
Yeah.	No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."	0
Can't it go to any office?	What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.	0
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?	Uh-huh. What are they?	0
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.	Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.	0
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.	No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.	0
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.	You got worms.	0
You?! How about me?	Let's wait for some slow one.	0
No doubt.	You're a little angle, you are.	0
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.	Uh... No.	0
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.	I did.	0
Can I have one of your cigarettes?	You haven't smoked in two years.	0
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.	You will come with me.	0
Vomit?	I know you do, so that's why --	0
Yes.	You're WHERE?	0
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?	No.	0
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.	Let's go, Reggie.	0
Mmm.	Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.	0
Do not try your trickery on me!	It is no trickery.	0
About running, dying what?	Both... running's what I'm interested in.	0
What? What do you mean you --	If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.	0
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?	You're too clean for me.	0
That is idle talk.	Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!	0
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.	What the hell's that supposed to mean?	0
What was that?	Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --	0
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.	0
-- what are you talking about, come on --	-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.	0
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...	Susan, we're not b-	0
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.	-- it was a betrayal.	0
What would <u>that</u> be?	He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice.	0
Let me go.	How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?	0
What if it's not who you think it is?	If he crosses the bridge, it is.	0
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.	No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.	0
Why would we go to Odessa?	Not we, you. Stay with your mother.	0
Benjamin -- do they know you?	Of course not.	0
But how can he? He'll kill you.	This isn't about me anymore.	0
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?	I don't see why not.	0
Ask me them again. One by one.	What do you do?	0
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.	Thank you.	0
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.	You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?	0
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.	He wants a reconciliation.	0
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.	You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!	0
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.	All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.	0
So what's the point?	Jen please ...	0
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.	Way to go, Evy.	0
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!	Fine...  I want to talk to you.	0
Alex? Where are you going?	Done.	0
Which way?	Across both tracks!!	0
What are you talking about?	Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?	0
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.	So?	0
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!	To get me killed...?	0
No!  Never!	So, it was your first time.	0
Expect so.	Did my brother Frank find out?	0
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--	Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!	0
I told you! Right here!	But before! Where did you live before!?!	0
Getting loud, getting loud.	He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.	0
Here's a nice place.	Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.	0
Plato, where's your father now?	He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!	0
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --	-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --	0
Excuse me?	Didn't take long.	0
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...	It's ten after nine.	0
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?	0
Just an accident. Nothing.	What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.	0
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.	That's what you tell me.	0
Had the boys follow us.	Your grammy!	0
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!	Tish-I'm-tee.	0
You collect shells?	Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.	0
And why would I do that?	...I understand...	0
To be on the safe side.  I mean --	So?	0
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.	Thank you.	0
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.	Yeah you do.	0
I think so.	Affirmative.	0
When - when are you coming back?	I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-	0
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.	I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!	0
Yeah.	Sneak up behind me like that.	0
Benjamin.	No.	0
It's just as I thought.	What?	0
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.	I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.	0
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?	No.	0
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.	Do you really mean it this time Gale?	0
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.	You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?	0
No Juliet?!	it will be all right, madam.	0
Seven-ish	Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?	0
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.	What a relief!	0
Don't know.	Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...	0
Yes, it does.	He's telling the truth, up to a point.	0
Nicholas...	I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...	0
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.	I'm afraid that's what it is.	0
But you don't realize....	You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.	0
So you killed them?	The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.	0
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...	You got a suspect...	0
Have you finished?	You could have a great beach house for that.	0
How was that for a tight squeeze?	Don't tell me you were worried!	0
He went off someplace.	I wish to be your husband.	0
...How's the paintin' goin'?	Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.	0
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.	It's going to be okay.	0
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --	And a very, very good one.	0
Shhhh.	Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.	0
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?	Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.	0
Got to be Comb Bluff.	Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.	0
That-that wonít do. Thatís not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thatís the way...	Iím finished here and Iím tired, Emily. You shouldnít be here. Now donít make it worse.	0
Can I have my desk please.	Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.	0
Hello...?	This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.	0
What do you mean?	Isn't it obvious?	0
Lemme see that.	No way.	0
You don't think much of yourself, do you?	Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!	0
I wrote a poem too.	The secretary.  Or the file clerk.	0
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.	But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...	0
No!  No!  You won't come back either.	I can't be staying long anyway.	0
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!	0
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.	Lead the way.	0
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.	How long have you been downtown?	0
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?	Yes, Mother.	0
Donít  go, Jack...	No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.	0
-- Is what?	That's great.	0
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...	Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...	0
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.	It's wonderful.	0
I'm only half human.	Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.	0
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.	No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.	0
And is that it?	More or less.	0
But how can you be sure?	This is true love. You think this happens every day?	0
What are you doing? You canít. I...	Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brotherís not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...	0
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.	You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.	0
Why?	Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...	0
He looks sad. Do you whip him?	No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.	0
He's not in this class.	I said give me time.	0
William, you're not making sense.	I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.	0
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.	Because you're nuts.	0
Then what good is he?	...namely a personality.	0
What's the difference?	I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.	0
No.	Fifth of scotch?	0
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.	Here?	0
...I suppose.	I would say you're very shy by nature.	0
Please.	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.	0
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...	No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?	0
If you want to.	You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.	0
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?	Hey, he cheated on her.	0
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.	0
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!	How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?	0
What looks good?	Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...	0
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?	Yes, but --	0
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.	That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.	0
Pigsty.	Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.	0
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...	Okay.	0
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.	Never better. You sleep well.	0
You think I manifested the snakes?	Someone did.	0
No.	Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...	0
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?	Well, I don't...	0
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.	0
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.	Alright.  What about me?	0
And reverse the mutations --	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...	0
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!	I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?	0
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.	0
Just back up.	I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?	0
But Roki said--	Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.	0
Are you drunk?	Probably.	0
What are you doing here?	You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.	0
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.	Take the rope.	0
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.	Where had you been before?	0
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--	Don't you <u>realize</u>--	0
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.	It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -	0
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.	Oh. You know him.	0
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.	Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.	0
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...	Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.	0
What are you talking about?	You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.	0
Michael.	I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.	0
How many you see?	Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.	0
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?	Okay.	0
In other words you don't know.	No.	0
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.	You're gonna offer to set him up?	0
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?	I don't want to talk about it -	0
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?	No, Ben.	0
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...	That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.	0
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.	Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.	0
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.	That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.	0
You're on the grift. Same as me.	Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.	0
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.	Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!	0
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.	No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...	0
What is it, John?  John?	That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.	0
Huh?	The opera.	0
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.	Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?	0
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	Got a nice evening dress?	0
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.	I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.	0
Yes.	My God. I haven't seen you since...	0
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.	I feel really good.	0
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.	We're going to work on the message.	0
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.	0
You're not taking me seriously.	Damn. Your dad did this?	0
Did you find it boring?	Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...	0
A dressing bag?	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.	0
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.	You don't know anything about Joe --	0
We're doing something -- ?	What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?	0
I don't think that has anything to do with --	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.	0
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.	He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.	0
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.	And when she goes to those places...	0
There's nothing else here.	Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.	0
What do you mean?	My work may take me out of New York.	0
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.	I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...	0
Finished with these?	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.	0
And the blood let you out?	I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.	0
Here you go...	How do you know they're not?	0
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.	Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.	0
The sign of our partnership.	Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.	0
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --	He's hot.	0
We'll explain the whole thing to them.	I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.	0
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...	Like what?	0
What was that?	You heard me.	0
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.	No.	0
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.	Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.	0
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?	Did his parents attend to that?	0
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.	I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.	0
Ah...	What about Miss Lawson?	0
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?	It's only temporary.	0
Where's Ma?	It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....	0
With... with Annie, of course.	Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?	0
Tell him I want to give him his money.	I'm not sure.	0
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.	If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.	0
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?	No!  No...	0
You remind me of my uncle.	What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?	0
Did they deserve it today?	I'm not sure.	0
No.	In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.	0
Hello Miles.	Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.	0
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--	I'm back from the dead.	0
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.	Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...	0
Nice night out...	You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at youó	0
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.	Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.	0
You're afraid of germs?	You know.	0
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.	Good. Then I'll meet you there.	0
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.	I always thought it was nothing but red.	0
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.	Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?	0
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...	I got to fetch her home...	0
LAZ, I said let...!	You better pray, gal. You better pray...	0
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.	They're nines.	0
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.	How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.	0
Epps.	You just shoot at something?	0
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?	We must've had it delivered then.	0
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.	I want to be good to you -- madly good.	0
Do you like fish?	- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.	0
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.	But <u>we</u> let him out.	0
Of course.	Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?	0
You're one man. You can't save everybody.	What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?	0
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?	Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.	0
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.	I was mistaken.	0
What about your twelve brothers?	Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?	0
Benjamin -- what's happening?	Hurry up. Put your shoes on.	0
Now just a minute...	Ta-ra.	0
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.	People change.	0
Look how full of yourself you are.	I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.	0
Pinching?  Where?	But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.	0
Why, Terry, who said it was?	No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?	0
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?	You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?	0
It is. Honestly.	You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?	0
Peter-	I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.	0
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."	So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.	0
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.	And splittin' with her?	0
He's a secretive man.	And you don't ask questions?	0
Oh, Sandro...	I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?	0
Something wrong?	I'm a little dizzy...	0
I'll never forget you said it.	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.	0
Why... I donít know what youíre talking about.	You know heíd have had him killed, donít you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?	0
Why'd you drop out?	Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.	0
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.	That I didn't leave you there to rot.	0
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.	You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!	0
Oh Miles!	Tell me again.	0
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.	0
Why not?	Beauty and fragrances.	0
Oh, no.  Now what?	See you later.	0
I hate having my picture taken.	As of this moment you're six years old...	0
No.	Hydrophobia...	0
Yes, yes it is!	It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".	0
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.	0
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?	Yes am.	0
Something happened to you.	Extra money, huh?	0
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...	For what? A couple hundred bucks?	0
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?	I heard of one once.	0
I'm leavin' the place to John.	Yeah.	0
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.	Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.	0
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?	No, I don't.	0
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?	I'll take care of you.	0
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.	Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.	0
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.	0
And sound.	-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?	0
A what?	Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.	0
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.	I've already got more help than I need.	0
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?	Oh, some shit.	0
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.	For rabbits?	0
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...	0
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.	I know.  I'm glad.	0
Did we get it?	We got it.  On your feet.	0
We'll come back in the morning.	What is that he's working on?	0
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.	Italy!	0
It was wrong to deceive you.	But that's all behind us now.	0
You can't!	You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?	0
What do you think of me?	Can we talk?	0
Hello, Mr Crane.	I love this guy!	0
Oh, my.	Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.	0
You asked me what was missing.	Jess--you look good.	0
What?	Marc Chagall. A Russian.	0
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?	Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.	0
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.	I see you.	0
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.	Oh?	0
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.	0
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?	I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.	0
He was a President.	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.	0
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.	I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.	0
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. IóI did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?	Santa Claus?	0
They mean it.	Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.	0
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.	You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.	0
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.	0
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...	0
My kids want me to teach them.	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!	0
I'm so sorry... please understand.	Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.	0
The evidence of what?	Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.	0
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?	No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.	0
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.	0
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?	I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.	0
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!	Now, pet--  Jim!	0
How long have you been doing this?	We'll get a handwriting expert toó  What!	0
Don't you have it on?	No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.	0
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?	That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.	0
Like <u>what</u>?!	Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.	0
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?	0
What?	No.	0
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.	I don't know.	0
So you'll call me, right?	Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.	0
Want a ride?	I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?	0
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.	Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?	0
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?	Uh huh...	0
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?	Sure.	0
No. Ours was damaged.	What's in those files?	0
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?	On occasion. Usually at night.	0
Harry called.	And?	0
What do you want to tell me?	It was.	0
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.	-- stop --	0
No.	We run a pretty tight ship here.	0
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!	0
What are you talking about?	Was it something that happened at school?	0
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...	I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.	0
That we should take our friendship a little further?	Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.	0
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.	What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --	0
What's the matter?	Alright.	0
What other choices have we got?	I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.	0
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?	Did you hear what I said?!!	0
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.	0
Okay, okay.	You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.	0
You don't "have to."	Don't say that.	0
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!	I sat outside and had coffee.	0
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!	Yes.	0
Well, if that's the way you f...	Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?	0
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.	Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.	0
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?	I do.	0
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?	Yes... probably he was renewed?	0
She left a note.	I always knew that.	0
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.	What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?	0
What's that?	That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.	0
Hi... am I late?	Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.	0
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.	You look at me as though I had said something foolish...	0
Just for the day?	Thanks.	0
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.	'Go! Go! Go!'	0
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.	You have a job?	0
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?	0
I was wounded before Warsaw.	Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-	0
Sing it?	Yeah.	0
Let's talk about --	I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.	0
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.	0
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!	I can't do that!	0
Nigger, fuck me hard!	Ah!	0
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?	You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.	0
Sure - I think so, Stew.	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.	0
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.	I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.	0
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.	What?	0
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.	I'm staying with a friend.	0
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --	Of trust. Tell me your plan.	0
Yes.	You will?	0
I thought Blockbuster fired you.	Twice.	0
Did you get it?	What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --	0
What point is that?	Beth.	0
You still have an aversion to the water?	Which is?	0
Ed, can I see you a second.	Excuse me.	0
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.	Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.	0
That's right.	You know I liked it better long.	0
- opening of the Opera -	How was the beach?	0
Yes... I'll give you that.	Thank you, Sera.	0
...no... Mac... p-please...	What kind of infection?	0
Fifty-seven.	I'll be up later.	0
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.	Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.	0
Have you seen it?	No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.	0
I don't know... Switzerland?	We'll find him.	0
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.	Good point.	0
...You don't believe me, don't you?	....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?	0
Hi.	Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...	0
How crazy is that.	Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...	0
Is Crawford going with you?	What?!	0
How have you dumped girls in the past?	Screening calls. Any suggestions?	0
Unless you wanna tell me.	And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.	0
What?	You know how to drive a stick?	0
And what are you going to do?!	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?	0
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?	There's worse places, honey.	0
Here.	Must be my wife.	0
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.	It's only a machine.	0
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.	Did you know Noah Goldstein?	0
Coming to bed?	No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.	0
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.	I don't know.  Back the truck--	0
Don't make conversation with me.	Yeah?	0
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.	Everybody just shut up!	0
No, no, no, not at all.	Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.	0
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?	I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.	0
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.	I don't have to go through with it either.	0
I thought you'd be at the dinner.	He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.	0
'Really a lot appreciate it...'	Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellóO for me, Mom.'	0
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.	0
Why are we stopping?	There's a dog in the road.	0
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?	I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.	0
Were you planning to tell me?	We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...	0
I went out.	I never rent my gear.	0
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.	I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?	0
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.	0
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.	Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.	0
Will you get off my back for once?	Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --	0
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.	No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.	0
Change the channel!	I can't take water, Kathryn.	0
Are you wearing a uniform?	A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam.	0
Hi, how are you?	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?	0
What have you got there?	You'd look naked without one.	0
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.	Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.	0
I see.	I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.	0
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?	I can live with "great."	0
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...	Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.	0
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.	What about all those ideas you had?	0
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.	0
Don't get angry.	I'm not angry it's just	0
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.	I'm here.	0
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.	Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.	0
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.	Were you asleep?	0
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?	Almost four years.	0
Sure plenty of times.	I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.	0
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.	Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?	0
Where is the meeting going to be?	At the ship.	0
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?	We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.	0
Yes, I knowóbutó	Please.	0
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.	I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.	0
Why not?	It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.	0
I know.	Byrd's dead.	0
How do I know if this is love ?	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...	0
It's Craig in there, I can tell.	Help me with two minutes of silence!	0
No, it's...	What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?	0
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?	He had a mind that escalated things.	0
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.	I see.	0
You got a point there.	Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...	0
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.	Huh?  He's fucking loaded.	0
They know he got hit in the face.	He doesn't answer.	0
I don't have any sugar either.	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?	0
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.	We weren't sure we could trust you.	0
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.	Who?	0
And, what, I'm not serious?	You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --	0
So?	Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.	0
So, what happened?	I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.	0
It's temporary.	It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?	0
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?	Well, I really don't drink...	0
Nope.	She didn't give you my address?	0
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.	Well... we're glad to have you.	0
The bomb, asshole!	Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?	0
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!	No, Starla! No!	0
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...	Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...	0
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.	You could see the speedometer?	0
It's already started.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.	0
I'll go...	No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.	0
They'll run you out.	No, they won't.	0
I am not!	I don't wanna go.	0
If that's all right.	He's an undertaker.	0
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?	You smell like formaldehyde.	0
It's not here, Caesar.	Where, then?	0
Trust Leonardo....	Wha.....	0
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.	He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.	0
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?	And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.	0
Where's Sam?	He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.	0
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.	Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.	0
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?	Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.	0
Are you seeing Betty tonight?	It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --	0
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?	Take the rope.	0
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...	I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...	0
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.	I did.	0
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --	What're you doing here anyway?	0
You're not very ambitious, are you?	The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?	0
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?	0
Hola..	That's correct.	0
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.	Dad.	0
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?	I'm thinking about it.	0
That guy rules!	Huh?	0
Go. Iím sorry, you should just go...	No. I'll be right back.	0
What?	Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.	0
Now that it's out of your system.	Like...ah...	0
Oh, don't worry about that.	What?	0
Hi.	What'd he say?	0
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?	You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.	0
Is that how you answer the phone?	I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.	0
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.	Don? Where is he?	0
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.	Oh, okay.  Here it comes.	0
Yeah--that's right. Diz--	Some kind of archive --	0
What about you?	There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.	0
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.	Yes -- I do understand.	0
I'm right here.	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.	0
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.	At least around here it does.	0
No.	Yeah.	0
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	0
What's wrong with you?	Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.	0
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.	My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?	0
What were you doing up so late?	Hunhh? Nothing.	0
Did you find Rennie?	No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--	0
What is this place?	Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.	0
I'm late for surgery.	Did you know my mother died recently?	0
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.	Good question.	0
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.	You wouldn't.	0
Benjamin?	It's okay.  Last one.	0
Love it!	Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.	0
This morning.	Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit	0
Where's your mom?	She died.	0
What?	I didn't think I wanted to.	0
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.	I'm not that sick.	0
Something like that.	Forget it. Just get out of here.	0
What'd I say?	Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.	0
What?  That's horrible!	What happened?	0
There's nobody here. Jason...	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.	0
Tell me all the details.	Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--	0
...Ray?	Yeah.	0
Danger?	. Yeah!	0
See anything interesting?	Not yet.	0
Is that how you play?	I try.	0
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?	The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.	0
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.	Where?	0
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.	I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.	0
Any suggestions, Admiral?	Is that what you think I was thinking?	0
You poor, poor boy.	I hear that's a rather popular date.	0
Really?	You like it?	0
Why would we be involved with these people?	I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.	0
Ooh! Can we?!	There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.	0
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?	I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.	0
Yes -- it would be nice.	What would?	0
Oh but why "alas?"	Nothing.	0
I guess it's not that obvious, then.	What?	0
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.	Pinned? What does that mean?	0
How long does this go on?	I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...	0
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --	I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.	0
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.	Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.	0
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.	Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.	0
Please, I want to go back...	He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.	0
Why are you asking me this?	Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?	0
With what?	No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.	0
Don't be funny.	Fuck me...	0
To see Dad?	Yes, I reckon that's it.	0
Let him try.	Fifteen years, yeah.	0
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.	I didn't know you were so kinky.	0
Ouch!	I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?	0
That's lucky.	Saturday, I think we should	0
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.	0
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.	Who the hell owns that dog?	0
Noooo!	I've been in prison, remember?	0
How about a hippopotamus?	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!	0
It's an expose on cafeteria food.	And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!	0
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?	0
Now many?	That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.	0
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.	Why should I go?	0
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.	She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.	0
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.	No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.	0
It will be okay.	*What* will be okay?	0
What did you stop it for?	I want you to take a good look at that face.	0
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.	Okay.	0
Nothing is going on with us, is it?	Going on?	0
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.	And what did he say?	0
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.	Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.	0
Will it change my life?	Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!	0
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?	Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.	0
Seriously.	Ok.	0
On the Bar T... looking for... them.	I don't like to give up.	0
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.	Pumpkin?	0
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.	Great. What's the latest we can get there?	0
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.	Is that your real name? Really?	0
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.	Are you busy on Saturday?	0
There's a young girl to see you.	Far as I know.	0
Stepmother.	But why, Claudia?... Why?	0
I tried again and got through.	What's wrong?	0
I'm not crowding you, am I?	Sounds good. But right now I should go.	0
Please leave.	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--	0
Every time!	You know - I play tenor sax.	0
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.	0
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --	I don't think so...	0
What's wrong?	I don't know.	0
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.	Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --	0
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.	But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.	0
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.	That suits you.	0
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.	That's good.	0
Good.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?	0
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.	Who?	0
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?	College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...	0
Are you really serious? About acting?	Why... yes.	0
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.	I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.	0
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?	Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.	0
And you ended up at UC Berkely --	I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?	0
Hi.	Hi.	0
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?	Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.	0
Nope.	He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.	0
I don't know.	-- Listen to me --	0
I mean it.	Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.	0
But what happened to the little deer?	Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.	0
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.	I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.	0
Oh!	The Albacore Club.	0
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --	Be sorry for nothing.	0
- - shut up.	You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?	0
What's wrong, Danny?	And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.	0
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.	0
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?	Turn that thing off.	0
To you, too?	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.	0
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?	But what?	0
Yeah?	What?	0
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.	I need you to teach me.	0
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?	It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.	0
-- which is --	-- which is a hack.	0
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!	Otis!	0
Oh, George, George, George.	Do you think that's what he wants?	0
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.	Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.	0
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.	Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.	0
Edward, I can't.	Shush.  Of course you can.	0
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!	0
Get on the bus.	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.	0
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.	Seemed, not was.	0
What <u>is</u> your problem?	Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.	0
Hi, Ted.	Oh god!	0
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.	6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?	0
Feeling a little better, I see.	What's that?	0
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.	No sweetheart, you can't.	0
Am I as good as they?	Why not?	0
Who are you?	Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.	0
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!	0
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...	Just in case...	0
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!	My mother's like that.	0
Where's he going?	I don't know, I can't say --	0
Well...Annie for one.	I don't think you trust anybody, do you?	0
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.	I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.	0
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	Only if you were in it. Are you?	0
Why?	Nothing I didn't think of you before.	0
But this is life. This isn't a movie.	Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.	0
Harry-?	That I didn't leave you there to rot.	0
I can't hear a word you're saying!	Forget it.	0
Quien es? [Who is it?]	I was?	0
She had the same.	Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.	0
You're not going to tell me, are you?	Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.	0
We been through that.	What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.	0
Noooo....	She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to	0
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?	Nothing. I think I twisted my --	0
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...	What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?	0
You think he's for real?	He's from another world.	0
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!	0
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?	Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.	0
Tea?	You got wax in your ears?	0
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.	Naw, it's... I mean...	0
Guess what"s under these coconuts.	No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.	0
It's a Calder.	I know.	0
I like calling you David.	I like it too.	0
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?	You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.	0
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.	I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.	0
Animal, I can't.	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.	0
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.	Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.	0
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.	All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.	0
Stop it!	Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.	0
It is to be expected on a Sunday.	It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.	0
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.	Can you come with me in my dreams?	0
But it would hurt.	I have to go to New York tomorrow.	0
You believe in anything?	I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.	0
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?	Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.	0
He's... he's dead.	I'm not in the mood.	0
Drink this! It will dull your pain.	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.	0
David, what are you doing?	I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.	0
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.	Underground.	0
You're killing me...	And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.	0
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.	Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.	0
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.	You won't have to.	0
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.	You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?	0
...Well, yah. Who's this?	This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?	0
What did he say?	He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.	0
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.	If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.	0
No.	I know it well.	0
I just heard.	What do I do?  How do I spin this?	0
Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?	0
You mean you can't fall in love?	I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.	0
I got you, Del...	The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...	0
Because you don't really seem here.	I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!	0
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.	I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...	0
Is she...?	Toss the flare down!	0
You mean my other self ...	Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?	0
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?	Not too active.	0
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?	Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.	0
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?	Ok.	0
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?	I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.	0
Homework. It's more interesting.	Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?	0
Too complicated.	That's fine.	0
Bud, something really important is happening here.	Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--	0
Yeah. But not any more.	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.	0
Oh?	I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.	0
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.	You don't have to--	0
This is boring, guys.	I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.	0
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?	0
You said you'd call my father.	Let me.	0
Did you always want to be a lawyer?	No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.	0
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.	Well, yeah, kind of.	0
And your Social Security number.	Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?	0
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.	I'll say she is!	0
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.	Then tell me when the whales are leaving.	0
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.	Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.	0
To you?	No, not to me, for me, for the camera.	0
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?Öshe lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeÖOrsino.	Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.	0
That's too bad.	Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.	0
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?	Wait a minute.  Youíre my wife?	0
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.	You're not?	0
Oh?  Where you going?	West.	0
Just had one.	Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!	0
...But first I gotta know what happened.	What do you want to know?	0
I thought I could give you a lift back.	Are you coming home?	0
No.  Richard talked to his parents.	You know.	0
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.	Obviously.  Very difficult.	0
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.	Uh huh...	0
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...	What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.	0
How was your plane ride?	Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.	0
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.	0
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.	Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...	0
Not that late.	Please. I want to see you home. All right?	0
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.	Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.	0
"Father of the Bride."	Not very well.	0
Why do you do that?	What?	0
I told you, I'm good at this.	Plus you have nothing else to do all day.	0
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.	Maybe it's better that way.	0
Mine.	Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?	0
Oh! Italian, right?	Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?	0
Promise me, Benjamin.	All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.	0
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.	How come so many of the books are in Spanish?	0
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.	I - I - I...	0
Mmm hmm.	How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-	0
We thought a doctor might help.	Your old beau?	0
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.	...Why didn't he close the window?	0
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --	0
They'll love that.	See you tomorrow, maybe.	0
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?	I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.	0
We should try fishing again.	You mean it?	0
Where are you going?	It's twelve-thirty!	0
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.	0
What do you mean "on his way up"!?	No. Women're always followin' me 'round.	0
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.	Oh, is he bald and amorphous?	0
Wynant's body?	-- just wonderful.	0
Of course.	Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.	0
How the hell did it get in here?	You are direct, aren't you?	0
Wait a minute!  Let go there!	Murder, uh?	0
No.	How come?	0
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?	Yeah.  I am.	0
Antarctica??	Do you know where you are, Fran?	0
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...	What do you mean?	0
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.	Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?	0
Why yes.	You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.	0
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.	Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.	0
Oh, of course. What is your name?	His wife changed the channel.	0
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...	You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --	0
Why would we do that?	I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?	0
You called the police?	Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.	0
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?	I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.	0
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!	You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.	0
A toast?	Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.	0
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?	All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?	0
Okay. Good-bye.	So long.	0
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.	Not for a moment.	0
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --	Ellie, it was a formal party...	0
Get off my property.	You'd think I was mad.	0
So what's it like?	Because...?	0
Lips still for sale?	Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.	0
It was...  ...one of them!	What was it like?	0
Tir Asleen.	There's nobody here.	0
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...	To him.	0
Maybe I should drive this time.	Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.	0
I was being foolish?	No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.	0
They're watching us now.	If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.	0
You work at Cook's Chicken?	If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...	0
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.	The world of the dead?	0
He doesn't know about the Day Care.	Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?	0
Yes.	All right. No problem.	0
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.	You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?	0
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?	You wouldn't.	0
No!	I'll bring it back.	0
What are you doing, Ted?	What about a drink on the way home?	0
Because we can't.	Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?	0
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?	Again.	0
Well, I left someone very special behind.	It's Bud.	0
Dade.	Is it really your camper?	0
It doesn't bother me either.	Gots no intention of ending up broke.	0
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.	Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.	0
What d'you expect?	You know, baby, I can't figure you out.	0
Wait till you see her, Auggie.	And what's that supposed to mean?	0
A little...	No, I'm okay for now.	0
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...	They weren't there. Get close-ups.	0
Am I cool now?	He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.	0
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment oró or human kindness in your whole body.	No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?	0
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.	Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...	0
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.	So he could have decided to go on a trip...	0
-- you phony asshole --	Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.	0
Yes sir.	No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.	0
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.	Light?	0
Not even a little bit?	Vegas. Can you arrange that?	0
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.	Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.	0
No.  You just looked as if you did.	No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...	0
Huh?!	A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.	0
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."	Stab it and steer.	0
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?	Nothing.	0
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?	You got me, peanut.	0
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?	I'm looking for you, actually.	0
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...	Well yeah...I know that.	0
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?	I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...	0
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.	It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.	0
What do you mean?	Yes.	0
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.	0
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.	Whatever you say.	0
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.	It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."	0
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.	Well yeah...I know that.	0
What were you doing there?	Working for the District Attorney.	0
Is this what you call the "butler"?	You're right.  We should stay.	0
Mind if I cut in?	What if you don't wanna be found?	0
... light.	Really?	0
When you do, let me in on it.	I will.	0
Harold!	I could carve a better man out of a banana!	0
Tell me once more.	I wish I knew, Edie, Butó	0
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.	I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....	0
I don't want to hear it.	That's the plan.  My word on it.	0
Steve. Thank God you came.	Your daughter needs you.  Go.	0
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...	I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....	0
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.	What ship?	0
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.	That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.	0
There's probably one in the basement.	Now wait a minute --	0
Get out!	The engine is still running.	0
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.	It did.	0
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--	I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.	0
He did.	Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.	0
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.	Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.	0
I want to know about Treadstone.	To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.	0
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.	Sweetheart, you're drunk.	0
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.	My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?	0
How come?	A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.	0
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."	You're serious?	0
You're as bad as my father.	And the week before that?	0
You tell me.	What's wrong with your eyes?	0
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --	Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.	0
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.	Maybe he's scared of the dark.	0
You looking' for some company?	Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?	0
It's a surprise.	Well I've got a little surprise for you.	0
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?	0
We could use a little help.	With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.	0
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.	0
I want to experience childbirth.	Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?	0
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?	Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.	0
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.	There's got to be another way out.	0
-- Will he keep his word?	He always has.	0
At this hour? I don't think so.	Where?	0
No.  I don't even know why I do it.	Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?	0
Mmm, what?	Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.	0
Yes.	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.	0
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...	C'mon. We've got to get out of here.	0
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?	"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?	0
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.	I suppose anything's possible.	0
More cough syrup?	A medicine man?	0
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan.	0
Where?	My patient had to leave early.	0
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.	Very funny.	0
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!	Disappointed?	0
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.	Okay.  What's the second thing?	0
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.	How do you know?	0
And when things get in your wayó or people óyou just knock them asideó get rid of Themó is that your idea?	Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.	0
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?	It means nothing.	0
What id we run into someone I know?	You crazy?	0
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?	Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.	0
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?	I do like you, Sheila.	0
Yes.	Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.	0
Sure I am. It's fun.	Mm. And your like, what else?	0
Not one of Steven's finer moments.	How should I know?	0
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?	Come with me.	0
Seriously.	And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?	0
Do you talk with your mom?	Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.	0
That's not really a very proper question.	Up, up, up.	0
Anthony, Daddy's busy.	...but big.	0
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.	Like the quiche?	0
I'm trying to quit.	To calm your anxiety.	0
A secret, I like that.	You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.	0
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.	0
Well, that'll be a little complicated --	I'll come along.	0
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.	Ah, well...	0
Do you remember a Miss Simms?	I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.	0
Well, we can take my truck then.	No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.	0
Jesus, Lenny.	Make it our first date.	0
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.	We can take the filters from the Clark...	0
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.	Is he working?	0
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.	0
Possibly.	My act?!	0
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.	You first.	0
You're my handsome man.	I'm a bad person.	0
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.	Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"	0
What are you talking about?	Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.	0
What's that?	That obvious, huh?	0
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.	0
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?	Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...	0
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?	I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.	0
Stop it.	He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?	0
I'll be down in a minute	O.K.	0
We have to go back for Daddy!	Daddy's dead.	0
Didn't hear it.	Yes, thank you.	0
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.	I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.	0
Can I go to the hospital with you?	I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.	0
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...	If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?	0
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.	When did he say it, Norma?	0
What?	I have to go to the Diplomat.	0
Alex... people are staring.	I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.	0
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.	Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!	0
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'	I swear.	0
Did you find your father?	Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.	0
I like that too.	Look at the way I live.	0
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?	This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.	0
The arrangement is over!	No kidding. NO KIDDING!	0
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?	I don't know it was stolen until I got here.	0
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?	Thatís why I work for Big Ed?	0
Am I interrupting?	Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?	0
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.	Tsch, what'd the doctor say?	0
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?	Been where?	0
But you will not... be safe...	Who the fuck cares?	0
Can I tell you something?	I'd hardly describe It that way ó- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.	0
Yes.	I can think of worse ways to go--	0
Youíve always got that to hide behind, donít you? Itís just business!	Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.	0
... Why... No, I don't think so...	That's good.	0
Change my name.	What, you think the guy should change his name?	0
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?	I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.	0
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?	No, I don't.	0
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?	No.	0
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.	Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?	0
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?	Then I'd think there must be a reason.	0
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --	Hey! Where's that martini?!	0
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?	They're discussing it.	0
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...	Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?	0
Just think about it.	I've got problems.	0
I could save you the trouble.	No trouble.	0
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.	Adonis thought your brotherís bodyíd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnít he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...	0
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.	Otis!	0
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!	Don't go in! Wait for back-up!	0
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.	It's summer! You're kids! Go play!	0
Must be a spare set.	I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!	0
Fun though, wasn't it?	A forty-five.	0
Goodbye.	Bye!	0
Wanna fuck?	That's a lie!	0
Thanks for helping.	Not at all.	0
What?	...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?	0
So.  What happens now?	Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. ñI'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.	0
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.	Yes. Yes, I have.	0
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.	Oh. Hi, how y'doing?	0
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...	Do you love me, Rose?	0
What?	We still have to go?	0
I got the message you called.	Come on in.	0
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!	Easy, now...	0
Yeah.	I think you're lying.	0
What?	Party?  Oh no, I canít go to a party...	0
You're a little touchy about it.	Never.	0
Did you find out where she was?	Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?	0
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!	You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.	0
A little drastic maybe?	That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.	0
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.	Communist Viet Cong.	0
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.	What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?	0
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY	0
You don't know.	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.	0
...Who is this?	I knew there was something wrong with them.	0
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?	0
You okay?	Yeah.	0
Not good. How you doin?	So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!	0
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.	But they have.	0
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?	That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.	0
What?	The Boxes. In the House. I told you.	0
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.	Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....	0
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?	The name is Gillis.  I'm single.	0
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.	I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--	0
What kept you?	The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...	0
Like what?	Want to switch berths with me?	0
I can't.	I know. I'm sorry...	0
Sally?	Please?	0
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--	I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--	0
Did you sleep well?	Yes, thank you.	0
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.	...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...	0
I understand.	I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.	0
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?	Why? People fart backwards.	0
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?	What's going ON!!!	0
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.	Why, don't you?	0
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.	They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?	0
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.	Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.	0
Oh -- Oh --	Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.	0
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.	You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?	0
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.	Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!	0
That's nice.	But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.	0
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.	No need to make excuses --	0
You've got to be kidding.	No.	0
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.	Werewolves simply do not exist.	0
But not you.	Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?	0
I'll wait there.	But why, if I'm not hurting you?	0
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?	Zip.	0
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....	You don't understand...	0
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?	What happened with the tape?	0
What?	These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.	0
Nick, what are you talking about?	Yeah.	0
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.	With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.	0
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --	I myself --	0
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!	0
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...	Just dinner.	0
No, you do not.	From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.	0
And what's that?	Jam.	0
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?	0
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?	The cameras have arrived, Madame.	0
Are you alright?	That penguin last night, is he one of them?	0
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.	Barbara --	0
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.	Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?	0
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?	I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?	0
What?	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.	0
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.	It's getting dark. Go home.	0
What do you want, Stan?	Lawyers.	0
How's every little thing?	Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?	0
Maybe I want to feel badly.	That doesn't make sense.	0
That's great!	Fucking kike.	0
Yeah, sure.	Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?	0
I don't think we should leave her alone.	You're right.  We should stay.	0
Nothing.	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.	0
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?	Okay.	0
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.	Do you really think so?	0
I'll need the Rembrandt now.	You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.	0
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --	I'm not sailing his boat.	0
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.	Let's hope he knows that.	0
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.	Could be risky.	0
Sort of.	Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.	0
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...	You call them...	0
Huh?	Oh hell yes.	0
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.	I need to sit down a minute.	0
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?	Actually I'm running late --	0
What if he did?	Are you sure?	0
What?	Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.	0
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --	Please! Norville!	0
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.	I finished it.	0
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.	Knock it off. You're not mad.	0
Nothing.	Do you have the...	0
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.	You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.	0
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.	0
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.	Cute?	0
Afraid of getting caught?	Maybe.	0
Hello, Barton.	Yeah, well he did, didn't he.	0
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.	We came back to the house!	0
You're trusting.	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.	0
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.	-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.	0
"It?"	What if Tod... is just the first... of us?	0
Not when I'm with you, Ted.	Hi.	0
I am not!	You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.	0
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?	PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.	0
Ten minutes.	I'll be here.	0
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.	Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...	0
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?	0
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.	Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.	0
Sure. It'd be fun.	Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!	0
I don't. I have my own.	You grown.	0
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.	Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.	0
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.	I donít think Iíd fight you on that one...	0
Do you believe me?	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.	0
You think so?	Yeah!	0
I've been thinking about this.	Don't tell me what to do.	0
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.	How have you been?	0
Are you okay?	Looks like food.	0
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?	I don't remember.    I was drunk.	0
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!!	0
Merry Christmas eve.	Of course not.	0
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --	I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.	0
Dick, I can't even breathe here...	Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.	0
That's what you get flight pay for.	Maybe I shouldn't take it.	0
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?	I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!	0
It's November.	Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.	0
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."	She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!	0
I wish I knew more about her.	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?	0
I was beautiful then.	The most beautiful woman in the world.	0
No, sir.	Well, good night.	0
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....	Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.	0
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?	Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.	0
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.	Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.	0
Nice spot.	It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.	0
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?	Correct.	0
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.	Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?	0
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?	That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.	0
Listen, Walter --	I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.	0
Patrick? Is that you?	Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --	0
I've always wanted to ride one of those....	What is that he's working on?	0
He's okay. They sobered him up.	I swear on your life.	0
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.	Yeah. Good.	0
How long will we have to stay down here?	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.	0
Yeah.	No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...	0
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.	Rose... please...	0
Oh. When did you move back?	Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.	0
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.	I think a skin cellís the more likely of the two.	0
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?	Well how did it happen?	0
No bodies, no West...	Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.	0
Is he home right now?	Yeah...	0
Thank you.	It couldn't!	0
How can I look at you and say this?	Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.	0
I can't.	Tomorrow morning, then?	0
Simon, what's happening?!	He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.	0
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.	Depends, don' it.	0
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.	Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.	0
What do you want from me?	Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.	0
Hello. Are you still mad at me?	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.	0
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'	0
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.	Hand me the canula.	0
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?	I didn't --	0
And dogged when I set my mind to something.	What have you set your mind to?	0
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.	No you mustn't, my child.	0
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.	No problem.  If I can ask one question.	0
You shouldn't. He likes you.	You like baseball?	0
I can see nothing's changed.	Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?	0
Do you know where fuse box is?	In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.	0
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.	Colette ...	0
Have you found a place to stay?	He's not coming...	0
Maybe.	Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.	0
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?	Not in love, exactly, but...	0
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.	WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!	0
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.	Blackheart.  Aptly named.	0
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.	0
How do I know you won't keep them all?	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --	0
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.	You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.	0
Where did you get that?	Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?	0
I...can't.	Why not?	0
It's not mine.	I never said that.	0
We decided...	'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?	0
When will I see you again?	Probably tonight.	0
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.	You'd look naked without one.	0
Where are you going?	What?	0
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.	Yeah, baby...	0
What does your gut say?	Lily... Jesus Christ...	0
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.	Found what?	0
This is day care.  Itís where babies go when their parents are at work.	Check...	0
Danny's not coming?	No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.	0
Then --	No, not at all.	0
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.	It can't wait until tomorrow...	0
Why don't you come back with me?	Say, Ni...	0
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?	I don't know.	0
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.	I think it's my safest bet, don't you?	0
This isn't real.	Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'	0
Why not?	You can make a mistake.	0
Yes.	Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.	0
I tried again and got through.	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...	0
Can I tell you something?	Yeah, of course.	0
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.	Disease?	0
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?	Yes.	0
You swear?	That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.	0
Smells like dirt.	You get used to it.	0
He's already there.	What if he hears something he's not supposed to?	0
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.	0
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.	I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.	0
Yah.	I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!	0
Thank you.	Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...	0
Daddy!  Come on, a name.	I've got a gig tonight.	0
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?	Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.	0
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-	That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...	0
Little chilly.	The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.	0
Do you?	Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.	0
You don't have to be so touchy.	Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...	0
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --	But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.	0
Is there anything more I could --	I don't see anything, do you?	0
Don't you want to see her again.	We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.	0
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.	The last I looked, we were just talking things over.	0
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?	How'd you like to be married to... the King...?	0
Let me got! Where are you taking me?	Right here. Now sit down.	0
Were you scared up there?	You bet.	0
Perfect.	What?	0
Believe in Penny Priddy?	What do you think?	0
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.	And the money goes--	0
I'm afraid you have to eat something.	Please, really. I'm not hungry.	0
That's because you had a proper upbringing.	That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!	0
Honey, I could sit...	Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?	0
it's my first time.	That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-	0
Mulder...?	Like what? The moons of Jupiter?	0
Did Sidney tell you about it?	Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?	0
You've slept with twelve different girls?	Including you; yes.	0
How'd it go today?	Good...I'm tired.	0
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.	Yeah, that's the story of my life.	0
Unpredictability....	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.	0
Will I go crazy or something?	She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Mís life is part of the bet.	0
That's not what I heard.	It's ok if you are.	0
Your guitar is named Kimber?	Yeah.	0
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.	And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.	0
You gain weight?	He called you?	0
Why?	Maybe it's for the bestÖI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongÖPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?	0
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.	I know...I know. You did the right thing.	0
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	Yes.	0
What are you doing?	Lucy'd kill me if she knew.	0
What are you talking about?	Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.	0
Thank you. What time is it?	Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.	0
Oh come on. For her first time?	I just had a mental picture of...	0
Mn-hm.	I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.	0
Chuck.	What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?	0
She's got it.	I knew she had it.	0
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?	- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -	0
What's he like?	Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.	0
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!	<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.	0
And your stomach?	Empty as a football.	0
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.	Let's go.	0
Nothing, thank heaven.	For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.	0
Dad??	Oh. Yeah.	0
I don't know.  I'm not sure.	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?	0
I don't believe you.	I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.	0
That's right.	Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.	0
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.	Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.	0
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!	Baby, don't do this --	0
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.	Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.	0
And what are you? A cop?	I'm a lawyer.	0
How long does it have to be a new house?	One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.	0
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?	0
I usually don't.	Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.	0
Like love?	Good.  He's up next.	0
Straight ahead.	My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.	0
No it isn't.  You can't help me.	I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.	0
Oh my God.	Well, I don't want to put you out.	0
What d'you mean?	Just what I said. Don't look so scared.	0
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.	No.	0
Michael...	That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?	0
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.	I'm a what?	0
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--	That's what I say.	0
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...	You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?	0
Yes, I do.	Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.	0
Well, that's me.	Oh. But haven't we met before?	0
This is a place for workmen.	But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?	0
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --	Watch me.	0
I know he's out, but how's he doing?	Dilophosaurus.	0
You're NOT DYING!	Okay.  You're probably right.	0
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.	Yeah.	0
No thank you.	Mother, where did you go to law school?	0
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.	Why?	0
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.	That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.	0
Well then, I'll pray for rain.	I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?	0
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?	As always.	0
She died.	Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -	0
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.	Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.	0
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.	To my health.	0
I didn't run away. I left the flat.	Why?	0
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.	Well, here you are.	0
I'm sorry?	What are you?	0
Don't talk about Elaine.	Don't talk about Elaine?	0
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?	Yeah?	0
I don't know.  A lot.	Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.	0
Go away. Who are you --?	A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.	0
Not the other way around...?	No.	0
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?	Okay. I promise.	0
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.	Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!	0
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.	For God's sake, Lilly!	0
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.	Only if you can spare it.	0
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?	A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.	0
Indy? Did you talk to them?	Yes.	0
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --	Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.	0
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.	Oh, you'll live, Lilly.	0
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.	Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!	0
I think you must have had a love affair with her...	I need ya help again.	0
I know.	H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...	0
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.	What do you mean, next?	0
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...	But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...	0
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.	Call it a new tradition.	0
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.	Woof.	0
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.	You noticed..	0
No, Odette says he's in shock.	I'm sorry.	0
It'll never happen again. I swear.	Mara...?	0
Bigger and better.	Then how come you're talking to me?	0
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...	Oh, yeah? How good?	0
We will, but first I have a surprise.	A surprise?	0
Thank you.  Benjamin --	Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.	0
Annie goes to a great school.	Iím talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...	0
I thought you were punishing me.	I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.	0
She's finally asleep.	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.	0
Miss what?	That's impossible.	0
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.	He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.	0
Nigger.	Be more specific.	0
How much we got left, honey?	Am I getting warm?	0
Really, Frank?  When was that?	Listen--can't you wait till we get home?	0
Ahhhh...	I don't think you're so bad.	0
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.	If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.	0
I'm sure I --	Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.	0
Wally...	I know, I know.	0
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?	0
I look terrible.	You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.	0
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.	What?	0
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?	0
You're really one of us now, aren't you?	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.	0
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!	You don't have to tell me anything.	0
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.	Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?	0
You're wasting your breath.	You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.	0
Epps, over.	Either of you seen Dodge?	0
There's one called....Window... something with a window.	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...	0
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.	You're on.	0
Nothing.	If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.	0
Attraction is a complication?	It can be.	0
Yes.	I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?	0
Well, okay. I got you some.	No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?	0
<u>Adolph</u>?	Adolph J. Giron.	0
Let go of me!	Look, it can wait till Sunday.	0
Oh! Are you really?	Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...	0
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!	You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.	0
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.	She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...	0
All I told them was the truth.	They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.	0
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.	You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?	0
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.	Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.	0
Yes. Did you eat?	I love you.	0
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.	They were for me.  They're mine.	0
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!	Hello, how are you?	0
Oh great!	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.	0
I don't want to waste your time.	I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.	0
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.	Such as?	0
Are you crazy?	I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?	0
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?	0
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.	With the same friend?	0
Oh.	What do you do?	0
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?	Maybe.	0
Get the fuck away from my car.	I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.	0
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.	Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.	0
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.	My wallet.	0
But I like that one, Scottie.	You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.	0
They want your autograph.	Who am I supposed to be?	0
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...	Sure.	0
I like "godsend."	But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.	0
Were they trying to kill you?					*	Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.	0
Don't.	Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.	0
What are you talking about?	What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?	0
What?	Itís cute.	0
I'm not disturbed. By you.	My lady friend has a personality disorder.	0
Headache, nausea, lights?	Lights?	0
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.	You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.	0
You know your history.	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.	0
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.	Yeah, I know it's small.	0
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?	I love to get pie after a movie.	0
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.	Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.	0
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.	On the phone. Was it for you?	0
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?	That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.	0
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.	Then you're out and you get nothing.	0
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.	No.  Not yet.	0
You want me to leave?	Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.	0
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.	You sure it wasn't me?	0
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.	Probably hear back from CNN first.	0
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.	You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.	0
Are you talking to me!	Yeah. Come onówe're stopping here for the night.	0
What is it?	Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?	0
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?	You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.	0
I have a way with animals.	It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.	0
Yes.	See you.	0
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.	We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.	0
On his back, I suppose.	No.	0
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..	So do I.  Sort of.	0
...school's fine...	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?	0
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.	[Beat] What?	0
You really believe all that?	Yeah.  Well, mostly.	0
You're welcome.	Where had you been before?	0
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.	Vanity Fair?	0
But you knew this was important to me.	What, your virginity? Well that's over now.	0
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.	Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.	0
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...	What gives you that idea?	0
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.	Silly looking bunch.	0
I don't believe it.	Are you?	0
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.	Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.	0
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?	Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?	0
I... I don't know what your name is.	YAAA!	0
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.	Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...	0
No, it's not.	I don't know, they just did.	0
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?	Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!	0
Benjamin Franklin High School.	Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.	0
Sure ... Where would we go?	Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.	0
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?	Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.	0
Bye-bye.	Now hang up.	0
They won't.	That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?	0
Two hundred pounds.	You paid two hundred pounds for this?	0
But I'll have cocktails with you.	When?	0
But	I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.	0
Who told them that?	I have no idea.	0
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.	0
Three agents killed by bad weather...	... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...	0
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?	Well, I have a pretty good idea.	0
It'll never happen again. I swear.	It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.	0
Of course.	I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.	0
And your wife? Where's she?	She's dead.	0
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.	Well, it was a silly question.	0
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.	0
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.	xxxxxx	0
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.	I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.	0
I found this.	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !	0
Naturally I think so.	Mine's J.F. Sebastian.	0
We have a gift?	Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?	0
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.	That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?	0
See anything?	He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!	0
Eighteen.	I bet you did.	0
I came to feed your fish. I didnít know...	Oh... how come?	0
Am I bothering you?	No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?	0
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.	I'll be at the bridge.	0
Let me alone, will you?	No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.	0
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.	Are you lyin' to me?	0
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?	Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!	0
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.	I'm not the One.	0
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.	You're going to see a Wizard?	0
What?	Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!	0
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.	0
You may.	Oh come on, that's ridic -	0
They belong to the people.	The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?	0
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?	I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.	0
Am I not safe enough with you, John?	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.	0
Was she one of your teachers?	Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.	0
Are you using minoxidil?	No. I'm not. Why should I ?	0
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.	0
Something soft.	Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?	0
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?	Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!	0
I told him about your car.	Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.	0
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.	It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?	0
Is that anything?	Thanks just the same.	0
What are you gonna do?	It's me.	0
The talk is everywhere!	There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?	0
If he were still alive, maybe.	Fan works.	0
I-you know, I don't wanna.	How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?	0
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?	She's worried about the cow now.	0
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.	Yeah.	0
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!	A BEER, please.	0
Diet coke.	Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.	0
Biting you?	This is where I proposed.	0
But...	Probably not.	0
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.	Oh... how come?	0
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.	Over there.	0
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.	Did Vaughan go home?	0
Just say no.	That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.	0
Thank you, Louis.	I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!	0
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.	We're out of a job.	0
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.	Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.	0
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--	I guess so.	0
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?	Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.	0
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?	The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.	0
Yes.	No. No, ma'am.	0
Why'd call me a killer?	Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.	0
We're going awfully far.	We got this far.	0
It's not. I can't take it.	Erin. Who?	0
Is that true?	Yeah, it is.	0
Huh?	You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?	0
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.	Good.  He's up next.	0
Hello, Neo.	No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...	0
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.	Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.	0
Jack!	I love you, Elaine.	0
Thank you.	Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?	0
My God!	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.	0
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.	Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?	0
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."	Someday this luau is going to be all mine!	0
Would you settle for pepperoni?	Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.	0
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.	What did he mean by Huxley?	0
The mental hospital.	He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.	0
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.	Uh-huh.	0
Ocean air!	Smells like something died.	0
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!	GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?	0
Like what?	I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.	0
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?	I got my planet back.	0
What kind?	Johana, am I boring you?	0
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.	You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?	0
No.	Did you ever?	0
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.	And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?	0
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.	My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!	0
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.	That's not quite what I had in mind.	0
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.	What?	0
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.	That's right.	0
Maybe they had a big breakfast.	Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?	0
Right around here, in the food court.	Sit down, leave the bag under the table?	0
Lick me.	Where is it?	0
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?	No. What kind of bachelor party?	0
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.	She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.	0
What for?	Some service deserves service in return. No?	0
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.	You really want to know?	0
Oh, I-I left it at your house.	snow shovel or anything or something.	0
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.	You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.	0
Okay.	Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.	0
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?	Come, Claudia...	0
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?	I never went in that sphere.	0
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.	I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...	0
What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know. I say what I mean.	0
How much you got?	No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.	0
The other two will die without me.	You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?	0
I know. He told me.	Tsch.	0
Date?	Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.	0
There are Agency regulations about this.	"Intra-Agency fraternizing."	0
What's your secret?	Excuse me?	0
You sure you can manage?	I got it.	0
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?	0
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.	Good thinking.  What's all this?	0
I want more.	I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.	0
I like it. It's... sexy.	Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.	0
At least you and Kendall agree on that.	Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.	0
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?	It's inside a moving car.	0
You're kidding with that answer, right?	Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.	0
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.	Any gunshot victims?	0
A straight line.	Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?	0
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...	For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --	0
Do bullets really bounce off you?	Only when somebody shoots them at me.	0
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!	Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.	0
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.	More to drink!	0
Hi!  Hi!	What!	0
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.	Go you Huskies...	0
I just wondered.	Just wondered what?	0
You need a COAT!	Ash, you've gotten me enough --	0
It's three feet deep, Martin	But what could she do?	0
Okay.	...they just hadn't thought it through...	0
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.	Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --	0
Is this the Community Hospital?	I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?	0
Where are you going?	I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.	0
Sounds like singin'.	Oh, no...	0
Huh?	You did.  Well... thank you.	0
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?	Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?	0
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.	0
I know. Take some of my blood.	No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --	0
It's makes it easier. Okay.	I don't want to know.	0
You do?	I don't want to talk about that.	0
Where's Rob?	I don't think you do.	0
Peter...	How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?	0
Oh, what, in this section of town?	Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--	0
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.	0
Yes, while he was here.	Wait, what happened to the tree?	0
You're full of ifs.	Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?	0
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.	What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.	0
Oh, yah, a long time ago.	Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?	0
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.	0
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.	For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.	0
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.	0
Hi, Jack.	Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.	0
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.	When's school over?	0
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.	You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.	0
Oh, my God!	Where are you hurt, son?	0
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?	I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.	0
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.	There's no such thing.	0
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...	Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.	0
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?	Um-huh.	0
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--	Can't do it.	0
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!	How'd you like to be married to... the King...?	0
Why do you say that?	Because they are all the same.	0
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.	I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.	0
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.	Kirsty?	0
No.	Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.	0
And how's your bill, Senator?	Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.	0
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --	What?	0
I just... who what?	People watched the movies in their cars?	0
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.	0
I have no secrets from my family.	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?	0
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.	...I had a dream about...something like that.	0
What's wrong, Danny?	Look, maybe you oughta' leave.	0
You look forward to this party all year.  Whatís with you today?	Trust me on this Kate.  I really donít think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.	0
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --	No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.	0
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.	So where's the harm?	0
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.	Let him go. Let him take it all.	0
I'll call the police.	No, you won't.	0
You said something to him, didn't you?	Not yet.	0
What?	I call this the staccato.	0
And your wife? Where's she?	Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?	0
Three?	Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.	0
Who is it?	She died?	0
She grew up.	She's still alive?	0
What's happened to you?	You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.	0
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?	Nothing for you to worry about, darling	0
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?	Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.	0
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?	She looked good then.	0
Or what you see in me, for that matter...	Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.	0
Where?	Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.	0
Where are we goin', John?	I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.	0
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!	No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.	0
More confident, maybe.	I'm beeyoo-teeful.	0
You're sure of that?	Why?	0
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.	0
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.	A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!	0
Are you sure?	Let's find out.	0
You weren't dreaming about me.	I was!	0
Why? What have you been thinking about?	How to die, mostly.	0
Early, what're you doin'?	Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!	0
When's your birthday?	Not me. But other people seem to.	0
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.	Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.	0
I'm trying to be your friend.	Same here.	0
Lemme see that.	Why don't you go get them?	0
Talk away, Professor.	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?	0
I know, I ...	Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.	0
Who else ?	It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?	0
You didn't?	And you know what?	0
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.	Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.	0
Oh. Did you say something?	I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.	0
When will he be back?	Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?	0
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.	I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.	0
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...	But, I...	0
How'd you find this place?	Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.	0
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.	Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.	0
Don't push me, Duff.	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.	0
Tonight?	Well, that was plan A.	0
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.	What kind of whispering?	0
And that's why you're leaving?	It clearly is why.	0
Naomi, I guess.	What!	0
Mommy!	No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.	0
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...	Yes, we will.	0
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.	Oh, Vada...	0
Can you see light?	Don't.  We've had a hard night.	0
Here -- here --	I had to see you...	0
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?	No. But I've got a penknife.	0
How many girls have you slept with?	How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?	0
That's not gonna fly.	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.	0
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...	What?	0
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.	Thatís quick.	0
Iris.	No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...	0
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.	0
He tries to act cool.	No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.	0
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.	Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.	0
You think so?	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.	0
In a bird shop.	Yes.	0
But now you don't have to--	Then you're as single as I am.	0
He might be ready to chop us up.	Do it my way.	0
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.	Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?	0
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.	Man, I don't like that part.	0
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...	0
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.	You give up on her?	0
He wants to talk to you.	I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --	0
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.	I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.	0
Mind if I use the bathroom?	Of course.	0
In your car	If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!	0
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?	That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.	0
He's mooing.	You attacked me.	0
For Christ's sake, why not?	Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.	0
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.	Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.	0
Drunks are funny--	Yeah. Funny--	0
Medallions.	But, Mom...	0
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....	I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....	0
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?	0
What month?	Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?	0
Oh.  Want to talk about it?	I'm not the one to ask...	0
I don't know	Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -	0
Yes.	We'll sell it. Sell everything.	0
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?	I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.	0
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?	I don't know-like two-thirty, three.	0
You're not going out to look for them?	No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.	0
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.	I want you here.	0
No -- only occasional jobs.	Yes, ma'am.	0
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.	If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.	0
Right.  Call me Christy.	Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.	0
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.	Boyfriend?	0
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.	You mean it?	0
Terrible boring.	What else is new? Right?	0
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?	People without cars.	0
I shall be all right.	Which one is your brother?	0
I'm still poor.	What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.	0
Come on.	Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers	0
No, silly. I go here.	My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.	0
Where's the ice cream?  The H‰agen- Dazs butter pecan?	Shit!  I forgot.	0
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.	See you later.	0
The moment I saw you.	Some people got faces that stick in your mind.	0
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --	Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.	0
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.	Git along little dowgie and call me back.	0
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...	First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.	0
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?	Many others.	0
What right? Do you want me to tell you?	Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?	0
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?	She's dead.	0
God, that's terrible.	Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.	0
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.	I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?	0
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?	Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.	0
You might have killed him!	No. Please. They're going to arrest you.	0
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!	You really want that on your head?	0
What kind of backup do we have?	Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.	0
Dick-weed.	Butt-munch.	0
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.	Whatever.	0
This has nothing to do with him.	So you're just attracted to me, is that it?	0
What is it, a surprise?	That's right...	0
And to m...	... and you knew about this.	0
You've passed me on the street almost every day.	Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?	0
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?	Great.  Really.	0
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?	Highly, highly overrated.	0
Do you feel better now that you've said this?	I don't know....	0
Could you bring it up?	Well I'll hand it to you.	0
But sometimes I cried a lot too.	I didn't. I just waited.	0
Now I become custody of police department?	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.	0
Daddy, it's true.	Wandering.	0
That we should take our friendship a little further?	Yes...	0
Could you give me a ride?	I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.	0
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.	That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.	0
Yes I am.	It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.	0
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?	Thorazin.	0
What thing?	They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.	0
I feel really stupid.	It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!	0
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?	'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'	0
Hi.  You called me?	What do you think?	0
Would you find me...?	With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.	0
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.	Are you happy?	0
That's a big comfort to me.	I could be, too.	0
Somebody has to die.	Let me call you back...	0
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.	It burns.	0
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.	It's a novel.	0
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.	Certainly a new experience for me.	0
Yes.	Okay.  Good night.	0
Nope.	Anything you want.	0
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.	0
Michael.	No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!	0
What's the surprise?	Because I have to!	0
It's delicious, trust me.	Does it have wheat in it?	0
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.	Just in time for what?	0
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?	I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...	0
Um-hum ...	Right.	0
You do not want me to do your cover.	I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.	0
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -	I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...	0
So who -- what -- are you?	Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...	0
Yes.	No, I'm fascinated.	0
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.	I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.	0
Yes.	That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?	0
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...	You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --	0
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.	So what are you thinking for college?	0
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.	Yeah, just stay where you is...	0
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.	Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.	0
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.	Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.	0
She was only teasin'.	Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.	0
We're just burnin' light here.	You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.	0
Why did he?	Why did he what?	0
You had a rough couple years, that's all.	Good night.	0
No, Benjamin.	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.	0
By the way, what's your name?	-- Eddie told you?	0
Screw you, asswipe!	Is that good?	0
knowóbutó	I DIDN'T...	0
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.	Wait!	0
Tell me something true.	I hate peas.	0
What's your malfunction, Rico ?	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.	0
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?	A list.	0
Colored.	Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?	0
I'm heading out of town.	Okay.	0
Janosz?	I have a question to ask you. A personal question.	0
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.	No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?	0
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!	And you saw them happen?	0
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.	Whatever happens it's over.	0
Your boy.	Okay, I guess.	0
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?	Gabby, what is it?	0
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.	From what?	0
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?	What's wrong?	0
Do you want me not to go tonight?	No... we already talked about that.	0
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?	No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.	0
Hello, John.	I was married to her sister ..	0
So early?	Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.	0
You want me to stay?	It is that simple.	0
I want to have a baby.	Let's talk about it later.	0
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?	For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...	0
What?	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.	0
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.	I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.	0
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!	Only if I'm dead!	0
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.	Where is he, Niki?	0
I just need to lie down for awhile	Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep	0
Terry, you're bleeding.	Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.	0
I'll do anything for you.	I don't know.	0
What did he have to do -ó look at the body?	We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!	0
Sailor?	Yeah?	0
Sure...He lives there?	Sure. If you like.	0
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.	Whatever you want.	0
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.	It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --	0
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?	I'm living here while I build another house.	0
Really?	What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?	0
What am I going to do?	Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.	0
I don't like coconuts.	You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here ññ from Tahiti ññ Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!	0
I've been a Little dyspeptic.	Not a one.	0
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?	That one did.	0
Do you know what you're asking me to do?	Yes.	0
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.	I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.	0
Promise me it'll always be like that.	Like what?	0
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.	"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.	0
There's always exceptions.	I'm allergic to it.	0
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.	You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.	0
Why does that sound silly?	Same weight I always was.	0
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?	You're different.	0
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?	Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!	0
I'm a housewife.	Then why are you eating alone?	0
Oh.  Want to talk about it?	No.	0
Father Barry.	You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.	0
A little out of my element.	No, thank you. I have my car.	0
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?	I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.	0
Yeah.  We did it.	You really do hear a lot, don't you?	0
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.	Yes.	0
Don't go in, Ryan.	The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.	0
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...	<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!	0
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.	And why, please tell us, would you think that?	0
Jake'll take care of me.	Can you shut it down?	0
It will not help.	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.	0
I should be in by two.	You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.	0
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.	Still, you can't just write her off.	0
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.	You're upset.	0
That's not an answer, is it?	Yes, you're a monster.	0
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?	It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.	0
Smells like it.	You're too young.	0
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.	Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.	0
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.	Then you never loved me?	0
Like old times. Same booth, same song --	I had to see you. I'm getting married.	0
Goddamnit!	You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.	0
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!	And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.	0
He killed them?	That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.	0
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?	The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.	0
Why?	Because I'm done.	0
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.	0
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, weíre the past. Iím not sure if you noticed, but Iím here with someone else.	Fuck plan C!	0
Huh?	And I'd take it out on him.	0
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...	Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.	0
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.	Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!	0
I thought you hated Torah.	Calm down --	0
Closer to eight.	What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?	0
You sure you don't need glasses?	My vision is perfect....	0
I can't do it anymore.	No. Reba...?	0
No.	Positive?	0
A game?	Tonight?	0
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.	I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.	0
Name it.	Right. Wednesday.	0
You must be Hugo.	You must be Juliet.	0
Why?	No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!	0
That's...a comfort to hear.	I got it.	0
My dad was a Navy doctor.	Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.	0
How's the detective business?	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.	0
This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.	0
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.	And you turned him down??	0
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.	Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?	0
This is certainly... ah...	I only found out you were here yesterday.	0
What?	Don't start acting hurt.	0
I hate Sadie.	Well you'll always be Sadie to me.	0
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.	Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?	0
Bullseye!	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.	0
My stomach's growling.	There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?	0
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?	Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.	0
Yeah.	How long have you known her?	0
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.	0
This will relax her.	She's underage.	0
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.	Right. Seven.  Christ, thatís a long time, isnít it?	0
Where did you find this clown?	There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.	0
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...	You like me, huh?	0
Excuse me?	That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.	0
Yeah, I did.	Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.	0
But they...they could still be....	You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.	0
What have you been doing?	Wandering.	0
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...	Youíre kidding me...	0
Always.	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.	0
What sort of plan?	No, dummy.  Two.	0
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...	'Bout twelve.	0
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.	Call the police?	0
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.	I'm ignoring you.	0
I'd give anything to have been there.	I'm ready to communicate with you now.	0
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.	No. I'm not. Why should I ?	0
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.	Wouldn't they normally be locked?	0
At the block party?	...but:  this particular statue...	0
I'm going now, Cole.	I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.	0
Stolen?	Not exactly.	0
What a memory.	Don't you ever stop talking?	0
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.	Agreed.	0
I guess we've been staying up too late.	I know it.	0
Okay?	All right...	0
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?	No. I haven't. Have you?	0
Italian.	Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.	0
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?	He's safe in the Russian zone.	0
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.	Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?	0
Sudden flashes of light.	I feel fine.	0
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?	Why, what did he do?	0
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.	Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.	0
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.	I don't get it.	0
What are you here for?	I'm meeting someone called Natalie.	0
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.	-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --	0
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?	I know... it's the Russian soul.	0
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.	Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --	0
Okay. Thank you.	I am a professional man.	0
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.	It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.	0
So do I.	They serve dinner on the flight?	0
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.	How?	0
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.	Us.	0
What?	I've never seen a lobster.	0
A seven.	What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.	0
This isn't a game, Parker!	Tell him.	0
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.	Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.	0
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."	0
Should I hit it?	Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?	0
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...	Based in London, but with international concerns.	0
To you? In front of him?  With the...	Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.	0
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.	They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.	0
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.	I wasn't worried about us.	0
Who says?	The Father. The Father.	0
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.	I hate it too.	0
Look,dirt!	That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.	0
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!	See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.	0
What are they?	No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....	0
Sidney's father?	My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."	0
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.	Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!	0
To quarter-horses.	The whole movie. Let's go.	0
But he won't shoot you right then?	It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.	0
What?	That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.	0
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.	No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --	0
Why?	Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.	0
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?	Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.	0
So what now?	Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.	0
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.	You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.	0
No.	We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.	0
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?	That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....	0
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.	I don't know anything about it.	0
What's it about?	About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....	0
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.	I thought they'd have stopped by now.	0
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?	But, I don't know how.	0
You mean, before she sank.	No joke.	0
No.	Maroon, right?	0
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.	Will you smile?	0
I got an awful toothache.	That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?	0
Your view of what?	Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.	0
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.	He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.	0
Not if you remember my dad.	I'm gonna call you back.	0
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.	Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?	0
Stan... c'mon...	Maybe.  Maybe not.	0
My father and the Baron.	Bettes tells me he's doing fine.	0
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.	How is he?	0
Why did you?	No, they don't.	0
You can't buy that kind of publicity.	I hate this fucking place.	0
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?	Yes, aren't we all.	0
Yes?	He can't stay up there.	0
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.	There is no cure.	0
Then you should go back to your table.	Well, take care.	0
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?	I guess it was 1984, 85.	0
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.	I need you on this, Scully --	0
Dinner, Hubert.	I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.	0
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!	Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.	0
I'm trying to quit.	I've got news for you. It's not working.	0
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.	That last Martini.	0
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.	No.	0
Same as everyone else.	But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?	0
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...	It's a novel.	0
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...	I'm sorry.	0
Pretty serious.	How serious?	0
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?	Yes--	0
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.	0
Do you?	Pretty bad.	0
Yes, very much so.	Has she ever spoken to you about me?	0
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.	Really?	0
Excuse me?	You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.	0
...don't talk.	It's pleasant down that way, too.	0
WHAT??	Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.	0
How did you?...	...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.	0
Honey?	Mm.	0
... Population three hundred million...	Uh-huh.	0
What are you doing up here?	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.	0
That's a big comfort to me.	Yeah, but I'm buying.	0
Are you afraid of anything?	You did?	0
That's a beauty!	I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.	0
They got their stories straight.	What?	0
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.	I know.  Get out here.	0
More or less.	Okay.	0
To most people, it's an awful letdown.	Huh?	0
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?	I see the help -- judgement call.	0
You new?	Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?	0
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.	You have any children?	0
They don't know?	No -- they don't.	0
You walked out on a five year marriage.	That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.	0
You mean, like a trip?	Yeah, sure, whatever.	0
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?	A misunderstood bachelor.	0
It worked!  There they go!	No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!	0
Our salute will be a kiss.	We're going to need some time.	0
...thank you.	Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?	0
What do you feel like singing, Bob?	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?	0
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.	And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.	0
Simon just ejected!	Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.	0
No!	Letitia.	0
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.	Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?	0
Where will we go?	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.	0
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...	You don't mean?	0
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?	Yup.	0
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!	Going on?	0
Yes.	Were you at the inquest?	0
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.	I'm goin'.	0
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?	Okay. I'll take a half hour.	0
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.	May I have a suggestion?	0
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".	I know.	0
That's not fair!	Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?	0
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?	It's not mine.	0
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...	But Iím gettiní close, right?	0
Not exactly.	I'll try.	0
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?	Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.	0
Sir? Right now?	We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.	0
I don't really feel like talking anymore.	Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --	0
Yes.	So we don't know for sure about you, either.	0
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?	Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.	0
You're too good to me.	That's--that's splendid.	0
Can I bring Kenny?	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.	0
Good luck.	If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.	0
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?	Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.	0
What?  Why?	The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.	0
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.	Behave!	0
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.	Claire...	0
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.	They're Biblical. They were prophets.	0
And to m...	Very well.	0
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?	0
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!	Ma'am.	0
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Yes.  Yes.	0
I have so much to tell you.	Hi, it's me...	0
How're you feeling this morning?	Fine... fine.	0
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.	I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --	0
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?	I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.	0
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.	No.	0
BENJAMIN?	Yes.	0
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.	His father is a man.	0
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?	...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?	0
I can't tonight.	We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.	0
I thought it had a lot of merit.	In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...	0
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.	Not about coming to see Daitz?	0
Yes. It was very good to see her.	Really? Any problems?	0
On the train?	Just come and get it...right here!	0
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!	Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.	0
I'm so scared...	Don't be	0
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.	He's an undertaker.	0
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.	And you never cried -	0
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.	That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!	0
I'm not using him as an excuse.	Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.	0
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.	<u>So</u> forth...	0
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.	What's he got that I haven't got?	0
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -	Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.	0
So am I.	What have I got to do with it?	0
It makes us human ...	Hello.	0
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.	Don't stop now.	0
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.	Then he can move! People move!	0
So, it's from the future, is that right?	Can he get through it?	0
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?	Yes.  Seriously.	0
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.	I don't know.  It just went dead.	0
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...	Have you ever made it with a girl?	0
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?	Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.	0
Alright, now tell me. What is it?	There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.	0
Your father was a sick weirdo.	I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.	0
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?	It's been known to happen.	0
Get out.	No.	0
How was Russia?	Thank you.	0
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.	Hang in there, man.	0
Say, "Thanks very much!"	It doesn't matter. Go on.	0
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?	Have you ever made it with a girl?	0
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?	Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.	0
The silver screen's loss is your gain.	How about White?	0
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.	It's true. I can't live without you.	0
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.	This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?	0
"And this too shall pass away."	Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!	0
You're my handsome man.	They're discussing it.	0
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.	Is that Donald Trump's car?	0
Aaron, will you tell me?	I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.	0
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?	They say you never forget.	0
What the fuck is that shit?	I know what it looks like.	0
Who?	Thank you, but I can wait.	0
No one.	A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --	0
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...	Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.	0
Lemon.	Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --	0
How did he expect to do that?	An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.	0
What about Janet?	That's true.	0
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.	Is there going to be a later...?	0
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!	I thought I saw something.	0
I'm going to the powder room.	Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.	0
You're leaving, aren't you?	I have to...	0
That's good. So then what do you do now?	I'm a documentary filmmaker.	0
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!	I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!	0
Honest?	Will you let me ask you some questions?	0
Hey.	Got it.	0
I... yes.	Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?	0
How long you been in this town?	Oh, I don't know...	0
Go away!	It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!	0
Are you serious.	So we did.	0
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.	I won't hurt you.	0
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.	That what you think?	0
Come again?	When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.	0
Hey, I'm Sooze.	Yeah, right, publicist.	0
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.	Mustard's good on 'em to me.	0
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?	No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --	0
Hey?	By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?	0
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?	Then get them out of there.	0
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.	Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.	0
... could it be a nested code of some sort?	I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.	0
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?	Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.	0
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!	I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.	0
Do you still have that doctor's number?	Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--	0
We're no leaving you!	No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!	0
You're scared.	I'm not scared.	0
Then take me with you.	No. Youíll be safe here.	0
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.	Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.	0
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.	You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?	0
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?	Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?	0
Yes...?	Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?	0
What's the matter?	My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.	0
No!	She leaves, somebody'll be on her.	0
How do you want it?  The eggs.	Uh...over easy.	0
I just can't trust you anymore.	Just forget it.	0
Oh.  Oh.	...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--	0
That's probably a good idea.	Will you come with me?	0
You're upset, huh?	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.	0
See if you can guess.	Well I can't.	0
Are you alright, Wade?	Yeah, I would think so, too.	0
Drop some money.	Forget that guy --	0
Oh?	Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.	0
I can't.	What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.	0
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..	0
You must be exhausted.	Um, yes.	0
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!	Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.	0
Who's now vanished.	Yeah, I guess.	0
It sounded like Brenda.	I'll go take a look.	0
No óó not yet.	If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.	0
You know, all you know is what's good for you.	How about Bari?	0
You never know when or where a story will break.	Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.	0
Who?	Dorsey.	0
Did you think they were newlyweds?	I didn't notice them.	0
What?	Us seeing each other.	0
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?	I really can't give out any information right now at this point.	0
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.	You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.	0
What happened to your hand?	Uh-huh.	0
How so?	Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.	0
What... do you remember?	Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.	0
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.	I don't understand.	0
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.	I've met you before.	0
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.	No thanks.	0
Why are you so anxious?	Don't you know?	0
Frances?	My fiancÈe.	0
Your dead friend Jack?	Where did this come from?	0
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?	What am I scared of?	0
... Many men have tried.	Did they try and fail?	0
So Dieter has the money?	Erin, it's just a meeting.	0
No. I baked them for you.	No. You baked them for Whitey.	0
Where you gonna be?	Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?	0
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.	I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.	0
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.	No way ...	0
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.	Uh, uh.	0
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?	I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.	0
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.	0
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.	It affects concentration.	0
What about?	Every damn day.	0
Steve said for you to start on the boats.	We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.	0
Look.	What?	0
I was on Earth...	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?	0
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.	Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.	0
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."	I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?	0
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.	That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.	0
And I bet you say that to all the girls --	Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?	0
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...	You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.	0
When?	Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?	0
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -	I know that, Emily -	0
How was your lunch with Charlie?	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.	0
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.	It was nothing.	0
May I speak, sir?	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.	0
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?	Okay.	0
He'll find us, won't he?	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...	0
You want to see me, Senator?	Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...	0
Oh, you have my body.	Did you ahh, love him?	0
You know what they say about men with big feet?	No.  What's that?	0
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.	Who would find out?	0
At least kiss me when you do that.	You just can't stop editing me. Huh?	0
Go after her.	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.	0
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.	Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!	0
Jesus God, it's going through.	Sure.	0
Hey...	'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.	0
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.	I keep the heat on.	0
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??	Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...	0
You mean they weren't up here?	No!  They're still on their way.	0
What's that?  Present from Faith?	No idea.	0
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.	Where is he now?	0
Faye Dunaway.	Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...	0
No more about Beynon.	Whatever happens it's over.	0
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!	Please! And don't look at me.	0
You need to go.	The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."	0
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?	She's there? What's she doing there?	0
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.	But I don't know how --	0
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.	The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.	0
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?	How'd you ever get away with it?	0
My parents baby-sitter canceled.	So?	0
What?	Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.	0
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.	Why's it always my fucking problem?	0
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?	I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.	0
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?	I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --	0
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?	Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.	0
Are you on the other line?	Yeah, hold on.	0
We had an argument. He's being silly.	I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.	0
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.	It was.	0
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...	0
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?	Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.	0
Thanks. What are you doing?	Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.	0
Got to be Comb Bluff.	Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.	0
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.	Give me a break, I'm asking you out.	0
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --	I think I'll read a little.	0
They're out of town.	You jumped in?	0
How'd I look?	I'll take them both.	0
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.	Who?	0
Don't tell me to calm down!	It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?	0
You!	No; who were the three, besides me?	0
Is that what you're trying to tell me?	I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.	0
But I've seen her grave.	Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?	0
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?	...my soul or something. _ 117.	0
Cool.	I wouldn't give up your day job.	0
Moonlight!	Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.	0
In that case, I accept.	But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.	0
But that's cause he don't know!	Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.	0
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?	<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...?	0
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.	0
Makes no difference. Get him out!	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...	0
That was so weak.	We have opened a restaurant...	0
I hope you're well.	His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.	0
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!	Am I entertaining you?	0
He's beautiful.	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.	0
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screeningÖ	Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.	0
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.	Yeah.	0
Dick, don't...	Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?	0
Oh yes, of course.	Do you like me better?	0
No, but... why do you ask that?	What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?	0
Am I cool now?	Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.	0
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-	No, so help me.	0
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.	I'm not gonna kill anybody.	0
Here, boy!	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.	0
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.	Thanks, guys.	0
Yeah.	Maybe we can study together or something.	0
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.	It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.	0
Dickie was at the Opera last night.	I don't believe you.	0
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin	Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...	0
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...	This way!	0
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.	He looks like a killer.	0
Miles?	Yes? Marylin?	0
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?	It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.	0
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.	Is this the only way?	0
We can digest our-	A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.	0
Sounds like a threat.	You didn't answer my question.	0
It's not that --	So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?	0
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.	They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.	0
Excuse me?	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--	0
I'm so excited. Yay!	I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.	0
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.	0
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?	The way they move, they way they smell --	0
Excuse me?	Why are you yelling?	0
No, well...I've been trying to write.	Have you?	0
How about something to eat?	No, nothing.	0
Are you following me?	Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?	0
Only in the movies.	You can make a mistake.	0
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?	I was honest with you. I told you who I was.	0
Dad stop it!	Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.	0
You need to call your dad.	Leave us alone right now.	0
No.	He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".	0
I am, too.	All right then.	0
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.	You're a good girl.	0
Did they win?	Yeah. They're in the semis.	0
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.	I told you, I'm not going back.	0
Well, thanks a lot.	Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.	0
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.	Vada, this is an adult writing class.	0
Not good. How you doin?	Not good.	0
You don't know what I'm thinking.	Well, yeah, but --	0
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --	That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.	0
M'hm...	What's that?	0
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...	0
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.	A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.	0
Let's just be sure.	I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --	0
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?	Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.	0
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?	I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.	0
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.	I won't be late.	0
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.	It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.	0
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.	Promise?	0
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.	Yes?	0
Yes.	Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?	0
I got it!	Thanks, but you have a good time.	0
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.	You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnít one of them.	0
How did you find out about the toxin?	Yes... a kiss... salute!	0
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.	Doesn't matter.	0
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.	Your baby?	0
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.	I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.	0
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.	In a word? Lucrative.	0
That's following a train of thought.	Well?	0
And you expect me to believe that?	I don't know. Just a minute...	0
You better not be fucking teasing me.	You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.	0
I have.	When did you begin to question Lastday?	0
I am not!	Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?	0
How come there's no punctuation?	All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.	0
Guilt?	Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?	0
With you.	Where?	0
Gear?	Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?	0
Stay away from me.	Oh.	0
Nothing's been boring since you found me.	Let's go.	0
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.	You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.	0
Hello Miles.	Did my brother Frank find out?	0
Thank you.	How much time does he have left?	0
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.	Then what?	0
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.	Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?	0
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --	What's that, not great?	0
I mean porno movies.	I'm on duty.	0
Yeah?	We definitely want it to have junk.	0
You're dead!	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!	0
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?	0
Thank you.. .goodnight.	The limitless power of...	0
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.	Don't tell him you're here.	0
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.	0
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--	<u>Kelly</u>--	0
Not in front of the boy.	Very well.	0
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...	You don't sound too enthusiastic.	0
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?	I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?	0
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?	I'm curious.	0
He got a little jealous.	Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --	0
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.	Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?	0
Elliot!	I have been in love with you for so long.	0
Are you sure?	Your what...?	0
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!	Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY	0
Johnny? Did you see Ben?	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.	0
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?	Yeah.  Some of it was fun.	0
That's probably good.	Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.	0
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.	What kind of business?	0
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?	I didn't hear me say tonight.	0
What is it?	Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--	0
We want it back.	Okay.	0
So this is it, right?	I guess.	0
Isn't this fun!	Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.	0
You're not much with girls, are you?	No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -	0
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.	It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.	0
Twenty-eight.	I'm twenty-seven.	0
The library.	We have a library?	0
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.	Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.	0
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.	I think someone's watching.	0
No, I didn't...	It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...	0
Uh-huh.	He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.	0
Why's he called 'Invisible'?	You'll find out.	0
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?	...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...	0
I told you I slept with him.	I may have said perhaps...	0
What does that prove?	Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.	0
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?	Chaos.	0
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.	"For"...?	0
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...	I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...	0
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.	Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.	0
Tell me who you are.	Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.	0
I want to be alone.	Well tell her I said "hi" back.	0
No, no, no... I love my husband.	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.	0
No wonder he let her go.	Really.	0
What are we looking for?	So let's go. This place creeps me out.	0
This is the second opinion.	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.	0
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...	Says she can get me in to see this killer.	0
Thanks so much for coming over.	Oh, I'm really glad you called.	0
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.	0
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.	I left three messages already.	0
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.	Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.	0
Be careful.	I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.	0
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?	The South.	0
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.	Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.	0
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...	Where's Mandalay?	0
Thatís every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thatís why youíre here, isnít it? You think I canít do it. You think Iím going to screw up. Or get myself killed.	I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kingís daughter.	0
Want to join me?	Some other time, Cecile.	0
These scars.  How did you get them?	I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.	0
Let's stay here, Will.	What's the matter?! It's a celebration!	0
Why do you think --	He didn't say that.	0
I'm really sorry.	Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!	0
Uh, what are those boxes?	I'm going to the store. You need anything?	0
Yes.	Of course.	0
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--	0
You got it in a bar?	No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?	0
It's not something I wanted either.	What time did you make it for?	0
Look at all that silverware.	Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...	0
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer	Her favorite poet.	0
- end where I began.	Maude.	0
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?	Sorry. I just --	0
You looking for some action?	Well... I guess so.	0
Hold me tighter.	Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?	0
But why? What's the point?	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?	0
I'm the photographer.	Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.	0
But not for me.	I don't know.	0
It frightens me.	baby, please, please --	0
Doing what?	Think I could rent a scooter?	0
Ted!	I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	0
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.	Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.	0
You can't leave us here.	How'd you find that out?	0
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?	You'll get over that.	0
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?	It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?	0
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.	What's wrong with her -- ?	0
To what?	I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --	0
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?	What about her?	0
That bastard.	Are you staying?	0
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?	Iowa.	0
They died together?	The taphonomy sure looks that way.	0
Why are you smiling?	I don't know.  My name is George.	0
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!	And he doesn't smoke?	0
You can see her?	What?	0
Well! Nothing like experimenting.	We have his note.	0
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.	Married?	0
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?	Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...	0
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.	I'd like that.	0
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...	Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.	0
My ass if falling.	Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?	0
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.	I'm not even supposed to be here today!	0
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.	I did. We played three games of backgammon and...	0
You're late. Very late.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.	0
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.	0
Crash...I want you.	Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?	0
Is that the technical description of what I've got?	Is she against you getting help?	0
I want you to try something with me, okay?	You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --	0
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.	You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.	0
Back from where?	Which one?	0
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --	Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...	0
That bastard!	I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.	0
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?	Uh-huh.	0
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?	That's not quite what I had in mind.	0
She was selling birds.	Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?	0
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.	You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.	0
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.	Videotapes.	0
Nobody told me.  I did see him!	I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.	0
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."	You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.	0
Am I really her?	Then why do you want to talk about it?	0
Why attack Russia?	I just want to tell you something.	0
What are you doing?	I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.	0
It's okay, Puff.	I plan to grow on you.	0
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?	Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.	0
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."	Thank you.	0
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.	H'm?	0
Designer clothes.	You're all so perfect.	0
Jake, you are never out of your head!	Gordon Liddy, you mean?	0
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.	How's Frederick?  He didn't come.	0
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.	You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?	0
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.	No.	0
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.	Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...	0
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.	...I don't know...	0
Oh, are you a hairdresser?	No. I can't really see it.	0
I can't, Andy.	"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."	0
What the hell are you doing -- ?	If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...	0
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.	Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.	0
You are?	Yeah, come on, let's talk.	0
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.	What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?	0
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?	Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.	0
Let go!	Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?	0
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.	This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.	0
David, don't lose control.	I don't know	0
Paul, I know you've been out.	What?	0
I wanna let my brother know where I am.	D'you really wanna call?	0
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.	I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.	0
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...	Sometimes I think I do.	0
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.	What about you?	0
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?	Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.	0
No one's waiting.	No ...	0
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.	Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.	0
Oh --	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.	0
George... how about Felicia?	I can't be staying long anyway.	0
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?	I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.	0
Are you relieved?	Yes, but --	0
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.	Tsch, what'd the doctor say?	0
Busy tomorrow?	Almost.	0
What is he doing?	And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.	0
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.	Hello, Eve.	0
Sir?  What did he say?	Can't you please just talk to me for one second?	0
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.	If there's a train.	0
On the train?	Yes -- I will be on the train.	0
You're American.	So are you.	0
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?	Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.	0
He'll barely be able to sit up.	Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.	0
But it's a small room, Jason.	Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.	0
No?	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.	0
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.	0
Can't sleep?	You got it.  What's happening?	0
You met Basil Rathbone!	Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!	0
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womanóa trip like this.	0
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.	C'mon follow me.	0
My husband...you know him.	Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?	0
Just like old times.	Just like old times?	0
I feel different right now.	Yes.	0
But I just wanted to say --	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.	0
What did you just say?	And blind people, crippled...	0
Maybe the antenna's broken.	<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--	0
They went crazy.	Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.	0
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...	I was honest with you. I told you who I was.	0
What do you think he did?	We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.	0
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.	So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.	0
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.	I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!	0
My ass is falling.  It is.	Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?	0
I don't know you.	Ahhh, but I know you.	0
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?	I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.	0
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.	Uh-huh.	0
Go away.	But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?	0
Why is she in a wheelchair?	It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.	0
Hey.	What's up?	0
I didn't get you?	Oh.  Well.  Good.	0
I have to talk to you.	Don't forget the balls, Ernie.	0
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.	Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.	0
There's a list.	Really?	0
He kissed her.	Is that all?	0
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!	Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.	0
Was I?  I'm sorry.	What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?	0
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.	I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.	0
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?	About seventeen days.	0
I'm trying to.	Mary... please. This is hurting people.	0
I want him to at least see the sky!	Why?	0
He was gentlemanly. I like that.	What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?	0
...Where'd you get the pistol?	Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.	0
No. I will find you.	How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --	0
You hearing me?	I've been hearing you.	0
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.	Yeah. I can understand that.	0
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.	0
Are we going to die?	You know heíd have had him killed, donít you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?	0
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.	No--not offhand--	0
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?	No.	0
Because I don't want to.	If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.	0
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?	Once, maybe.	0
What do you want?	You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?	0
Ever been tempted?	What? To put one of these in my pocket?	0
Are you asking me for a "date"?	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.	0
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.	Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.	0
Nicer than most.	No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!	0
Which I told Barnes was attacking --	It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.	0
Oh God!	I'm gonna clean it up.	0
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?	It's valuable.  Hang onto it.	0
Television?	Yes.	0
Brother and sister no more.	Now husband and wife.	0
What the hell do I do now?	Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.	0
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.	What makes you think she likes me?	0
Who are you?	With Salvy, eh?	0
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.	Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.	0
Sometimes I really hate you.	Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.	0
He doesn't gamble.	Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --	0
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?	No.  I'm just being friendly.	0
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.	Only way to be.	0
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?	Tell him you want to see him?	0
Do you understand what I said?	Oh, sorry.	0
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	My kinda group!	0
My car's in the garage.	Maybe another time.	0
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?	How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.	0
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.	Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?	0
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --	You've had a better offer, eh?	0
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?	You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-	0
The nightmares.	Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.	0
It was one year ago...	Well we gotta do something!	0
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?	Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.	0
Oh!	Sorry. I just --	0
"Unlock my button" ... ?	The alarms go off ...	0
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.	Who?	0
For musicals?  That's part of the job!	No, you can't go out.	0
Yeah.	And...	0
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.	Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnít be violated.	0
Are you all right?	No.	0
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.	Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.	0
Not yet.	Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.	0
You threw it at me!!	I just let go of it.	0
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.	You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?	0
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...	Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?	0
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!	Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --	0
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?	That actually goes on...	0
Originally, Connecticut.	Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?	0
Don't go upstairs.	Come with me then.	0
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.	And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.	0
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.	I'm not sure that I care anymore.	0
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.	Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.	0
Woman friends, too?	Alright.	0
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.	Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.	0
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?	I've never had a girl.	0
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.	Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?	0
Great saints!	Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--	0
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!	You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?	0
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.	Anything else?	0
No, no. I did.	Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.	0
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.	Which one?	0
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?	And Fridays? What do you do then?	0
Before the actual accident?	Yes.	0
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...	Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.	0
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?	Yeah.	0
I missed you.	That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.	0
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.	What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?	0
I don't want to go there.	Do it my way.	0
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.	And you never told nobody about it?	0
Who would that be.	What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.	0
And what do you think you might have said?	No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.	0
Big talk.	A Turkish brothel.	0
Egad, were you horrified?	No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.	0
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.	Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.	0
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.	You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.	0
You don't like the one he was now?	Have you ever known me not to be.	0
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.	You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.	0
How old were you?	Shut up. Have you got your passport?	0
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?	Then why'd you ask?	0
No it doesn't. I see right through you.	You do?	0
That's sick!	It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.	0
Like what?	Does she have room for me?	0
Strange. I know so very little about you.	Let's wait on the power cells.	0
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.	I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.	0
Yes, I was lying.	Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?	0
I called Dan Koretzky because he --	Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?	0
See me, sir?	You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?	0
Sid Fletcher.	What's her name?	0
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.	Okay.	0
Where would I go?	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.	0
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.	It tastes like fish.	0
Donít patronize me. Theyíve clearly been at this a while.	Youíre funny.	0
Has anyone else every used your phone?	Just Jennifer.  And you.	0
I thought you were over it.	I am. Well, maybe not completely--	0
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?	What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --	0
I ought to call the police right now!	Well, I could ... free up some time...	0
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?	Yeah.	0
How?	You tell me.	0
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.	Don't worry, I've got you.	0
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?	This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.	0
Hi, Mike.	But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!	0
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.	The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.	0
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --	Cry-baby?	0
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !	0
So. Where are we sitting?	Jean Baptiste!	0
No.  You just looked as if you did.	No...	0
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	I'll mail you a letter, come on!	0
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --	0
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?	But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.	0
Didn't hear it.	There is something missing here.	0
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?	Look, baby, can we talk about it later?	0
Ah, an obvious choice.	Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.	0
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--	How's my pregnant chick!	0
Not another bill?	No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate!	0
Oh God, that's great!	Are you okay?	0
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?	Unfair. You are completely unfair.	0
No.	That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.	0
I'm here.	Sweetheart... I've been calling you.	0
You know Sid Fletcher?	No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.	0
Oh, God.	--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.	0
It was different then.	My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.	0
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.	My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.	0
Couple months before I was born--	You get Hardy.	0
Yes, I am, sir.	Then what brings you out on such a night?	0
Do you enjoy it?	They're real good.	0
Where were you?	I was in the city.	0
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.	0
What about Juno?	She's really a fox, isn't she?	0
What's the difference?	You know the difference.	0
Huh?	I don't know you.	0
Dr. Winkel told me that.	What were you gonna say? Go ahead.	0
Do you dance?	I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.	0
No!... No!	When?	0
No, really?	Too late for what, Sheila?	0
He's home. I sent the signal.	My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.	0
Neither can I.	Are they still together?	0
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.	Naah, I don't wanna.	0
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.	This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.	0
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.	He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.	0
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.	Mine's the Eleventh.	0
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.	0
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.	You earned it.	0
And far too aggressive.	I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?	0
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.	Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.	0
I do.	This picture--	0
Why? What did she tell you?	She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...	0
Slow down a second, you met with Low --	It was in the cellar.  Weird.	0
There aren't hotels?	Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.	0
I heard Julia and John got married.	Yep.  Eloped.	0
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?	That's what <u>you</u> think...	0
Is she pretty?	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.	0
That was a pity...	She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...	0
What did you mean by that?	Nothingó	0
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?	Is that what they're calling him?	0
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...	When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...	0
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.	I'm sorry.	0
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.	I've been doing good, though.	0
Yes.	Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.	0
Who the hell cares?	The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.	0
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?	Who?	0
I wrote that with my heart.	Do you want me to come over?	0
Please Josh?	Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.	0
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.	Erin?  What are you --	0
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.	Huh?	0
Sean's asleep.	That's great too.  Gorgeous.	0
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.	Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.	0
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.	"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?	0
They don't even realize they should be frightened.	I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.	0
We did...?	We're way past inappropriate.	0
Damn straight.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.	0
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.	He shoots dope too.	0
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?	He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.	0
It's too late...	I don't know yet.	0
I bought him a watch too.	Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."	0
The same day she supposedly went down.	Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.	0
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -	May I see you for a minute?	0
It must be the altitude óó you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootóandósaddle boys --	The whole town's in a state, Kiki óódoors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep óónobody on the streets at night óó	0
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.	If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?	0
Thank you.	Nothing, really...	0
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!	We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...	0
I'm off.	Wish you weren't.	0
How are we going to find him?	Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.	0
You work too fast for me, young man.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.	0
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.	You're always taking his side.	0
Well, stay here tonight.	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.	0
Oh?	I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.	0
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.	Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.	0
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.	Unicorn?	0
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!	She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.	0
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?	Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --	0
It's true.	And who did the voice belong to?	0
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.	Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.	0
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.	Seemed, not was.	0
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.	His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling...	0
Lloyd, give it up.	Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.	0
One or two?	Two, please.	0
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...	God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.	0
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?	That's completely crazy.	0
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.	0
The renting agent and the tailor.	How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.	0
No, you do not.	Yes, my love?	0
They moved it.	You're going to stay here...?	0
You're one man. You can't save everybody.	What did you tell him?	0
What is it?	They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?	0
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.	No, I don't mind.	0
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly	I like your hair.  And that suit.	0
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?	We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?	0
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.	What's stopping you?	0
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--	Mariette!	0
Why do you keep asking me that?	Cause I don't get it.	0
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?	That's what the witnesses told him.	0
Well, he has to rule out certain things.	Will you stop RIDING ME?!	0
Leon hung himself...	Leon didnít hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.	0
What?	You know what we ought to do tonight?	0
May I ask where youíre from, Mr Lamont?	Europe...  France. Iím French but I live in London...  ... England.	0
No.	Well thatís just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...	0
Yeah.	You talking to me?	0
Well, good night, Louis.	Oh God. What hospital?	0
Is this your first time here?	I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?	0
For the flat.	Uh -- sure.	0
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.	He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.	0
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?	The garage.	0
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.	Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.	0
Yeah, like that.	Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.	0
I don't wan to discuss work.	You have more in common than you know.	0
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.	I'm giving you a chance to walk away.	0
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?	0
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.	Fifteen thousand.	0
Big house.	A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...	0
There.	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?	0
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.	When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?	0
I was bewitched... it's better this way...	They told me you were dead.	0
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.	Eight Days To Go	0
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.	Thank you.	0
Well what?	I'll loan you a raincoat.	0
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?	0
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --	Lily!	0
Me neither.	Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.	0
What?	Page 87.  "I could never read that far."	0
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?	You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.	0
She...killed Burke Dennings.	Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.	0
I told Walter.	Catching a movie.	0
Charlie, let's make love.	We haven't checked.	0
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.	The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.	0
Mind if I sit down?	Gotcha.	0
Addison...	She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-	0
Why? Who said?	Donít you think thatís a little gimmicky?	0
Open it! Open it before they get here!	I'll be back when we lose.	0
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.	I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.	0
No.	Yes, I am, Norma.	0
Mr. Kessler?	Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.	0
With pay!  She is out the door.	You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.	0
Have you tried?	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--	0
How shall we get out now, Leon?	Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!	0
So, why did you bring this along?	I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!	0
When you don't they're usually nice.	The gentleman who came to the door --	0
John Doe.	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!	0
I'll say.	You can't trust those guys.	0
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.	Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...	0
You gain weight?	Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.	0
I'll be out in a minute.	I'm sorry about my parents.	0
What happened?	Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!	0
And Sanctuary?	Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...	0
Got any good ideas?	I meant he's a doctor.	0
I can't go right now.	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	0
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	0
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--	What?	0
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.	And?	0
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.	Oh, Tangerine.	0
With who?	Her name's Libbets.	0
With what?	Max offered to stake me.	0
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?	No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.	0
Is she a good fuck?	What??	0
What Kids?  Who went out?	I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.	0
Three?	It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?	0
What are you hiding, Danny?	Therapy session is over.	0
Apology acknowledged.	Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?	0
Yes.	Now?	0
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.	Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.	0
That's right.	No.	0
I still think you're a bastard.	What if I chant?	0
I know. Stop it.	It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!	0
What do you mean?	I think you liked it with him.	0
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."	Why?	0
You want some water or something?	You see, they don't really know me.	0
You think Lorenson kills you?	Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.	0
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?	Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.	0
Enzo, why do you guys do this?	Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!	0
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?	No. [Beat] Not around here.	0
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.	You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.	0
If we could just eat first.	Beloved wife...	0
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?	[Beat] Yeah, it is.	0
Oh, Nick... Nick!	Hello, Mimi.	0
Six thousand, right?	On the nose.  I tell you what, because youíre so cute, Iíll take care of our incidentals.	0
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...	Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.	0
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...	Where's she now?	0
Jesus...what do you want?	I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!	0
And these were drawn from life?	Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.	0
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.	That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.	0
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.	0
No.	Why not?	0
To keep out the cold.	How about you?	0
Wasn't that close?	I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.	0
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'	They're friends of mine.	0
Jak'tahla?	Yes, Norma.	0
What will you do when the money runs out?	Yeah.	0
Really?  Is the food that bad?	Oh no.  Not at all.	0
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?	0
What is this? You guys cops or something?	And that's what you've heard?	0
Is that why you wanted to see me?	I guess.	0
No.	I want to be near you!	0
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --	How did you know that?	0
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!	I can't keep my mind on the show.	0
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?	0
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.	I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.	0
-- never mind.	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.	0
Oh, it is?	Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.	0
Oh I don't think so.	He wanted more than that.	0
Do you?	In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?	0
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.	It's gonna be hot today.	0
Oh God.	You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.	0
Hospital clean.	That's long enough to get out of town.	0
I'd like to.	I could shore use some. Thank ye.	0
I know what you're doing in there.	Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.	0
You must have had fun.	You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...	0
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.	Who was the friend?	0
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!	Frances, I'm warning you...	0
Pardon?	I said--shall we get started *now* or--	0
What run him off? Tell me that!	I run him off.	0
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.	When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.	0
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --	C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.	0
Itís give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnít really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?	A criminal?	0
You don't, you can't believe that ...	I would now.	0
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.	Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!	0
I don't know how....	Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.	0
You don't understand.	Are you sure?	0
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.	Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...	0
Yes...	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	0
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.	I'm sorry --	0
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.	0
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.	0
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.	Wha'?	0
I don't find this very funny,	Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.	0
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!	Willie!	0
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.	Not interested.	0
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.	No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.	0
Tonight?	What are they doing, Doll?	0
It was just a voice.	Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!	0
I never met anyone from Seattle before.	But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.	0
Of course.	You're staring at me.	0
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.	All your friends call you Jazz.	0
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --	Hah... What about Nathalie?	0
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...	That's okay too.	0
I'm frightened, Mitch.	Why do you think?	0
Are you sure she don't know about the money?	I'm busy.	0
Go ahead then.	What're you talking about? You earned it --	0
Just answer.	We'll grant that.	0
You wouldnít be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.	For the gods, spit it out!	0
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."	I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.	0
So you don't believe in therapy?	Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...	0
I'm gonna need some money.	How much?	0
I got some vodka in the freezer.	Got some o.j.?	0
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.	Okay, okay.	0
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.	So it did.	0
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.	Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.	0
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.	With no laser --	0
All of us.	Where is he now?	0
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --	Good.	0
Beetle!	Good girrrl!	0
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.	Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.	0
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.	Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--	0
What happened with Rick?	We'll discuss it later.	0
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.	You're serious.	0
Ah...	Talk to me.	0
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?	You're entitled to your opinion.	0
Hi.	Thank you.	0
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?	This tie doesn't go with blue!	0
I can't imagine you crying.	Okay, knock it off.	0
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.	Well, I'm a puppeteer...	0
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.	My father has a bad memory, too?	0
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.	He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?	0
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?	No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??	0
No.	Who was it?	0
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -	- - a gizzard - -	0
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?	I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.	0
I'll do it.	There is one more thing.	0
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.	Who?	0
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.	Where's the note?	0
Donít patronize me. Theyíve clearly been at this a while.	What?	0
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!	You can bring them with a word.	0
It is only me.	Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.	0
I don't know what that signal means.	It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.	0
Air bubbles!... Doctor --	Yes.	0
That was close...	It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?	0
You can't afford one?	Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.	0
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.	He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author ó fat, violent, drunk...	0
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.	0
The same day she supposedly went down.	Nothing more? Just another feller?	0
Half a million.	That Beynon's got a long arm.	0
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.	I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.	0
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.	Sure you are.	0
Well, then, you must come back and visit.	All right.	0
Do I look as funny as you do?	I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.	0
I'm not the pig you are.	Who?	0
You... you... you mortal you!	My wallet.	0
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.	Nothingó	0
-- the sadistic prick --	What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --	0
Aren't you going to answer it?	Is that right?	0
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?	... All right.	0
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.	I think it's cool.	0
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.	It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.	0
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	What's your name?	0
And you can't?	What, you think I'm made of money?	0
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!	Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.	0
- - shut up.	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.	0
Would you excuse me?	Sure.	0
What brand'd she smoke?	Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.	0
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?	Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.	0
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?	No.	0
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?	Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....	0
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?	0
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.	Light?	0
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.	0
We're not going.	Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!	0
Alan?	Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.	0
She's not!	I don't think I am.	0
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.	Lily... Jesus Christ...	0
All I said was you were good.	Look. You don't know good. All right?	0
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.	Don't, Beth.  Please.	0
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.	Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.	0
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...	Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.	0
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?	Yes I am. I'm working on a wres ñ please call me Barton.	0
Uh, thanks.	You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.	0
Hold that thought.	I don't know.	0
Huh?	When you were his student? Did he come on to you?	0
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.	Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?	0
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.	Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!	0
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?	My mom uses color-safe bleach.	0
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.	What?	0
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.	Oh, okay, can I call?	0
And you can't concentrate with me around?.	Hey, don't be ridiculous.	0
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...	Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-	0
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?	What exactly do you think your job is, Private?	0
You're just realizing this now?	What is?	0
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.	He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.	0
It's the only way.	Drama Group?	0
You said you wouldn't laugh!	It's not you - it's the dress!	0
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.	Sure.	0
Where's the cabin?	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.	0
Did you see my father?	But Iím gettiní close, right?	0
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.	I'd sure like to know who.	0
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.	Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.	0
What was that?	An accident.  No one was hurt.	0
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.	This has nothing to do with that.	0
You coming back?	Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.	0
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.	0
I don't see how we can.	The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?	0
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...	Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?	0
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.	With this?	0
What?	Waiting's hard. You never learn how.	0
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.	How do you know that?	0
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?	I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.	0
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.	Yes.	0
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.	Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?	0
I'm gonna need some money.	They drive so recklessly there.	0
Right now, before I back down.	Okay, whatever you want.	0
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?	I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.	0
Fuck you.	Iím sure Iíll find a way.	0
Liar.	I saw them.	0
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!	That's good.	0
And?	What did he say, Katrina?	0
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.	She may be later than you think...	0
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.	I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.	0
Who are these people?	At least you walked.	0
So what's going on, Joel?	Me!	0
Coming.	Women are always late.  You'll find out.	0
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!	Ike, you could make a song outta that!	0
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?	Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.	0
Scottie, what are you doing?	I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.	0
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.	Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?	0
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?	Maybe that's okay.	0
Not too quickly.	Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?	0
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.	Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.	0
Burma!	My God! The fork! The fork!	0
That was an awful thing to say to me.	You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?	0
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?	Yes.	0
You can't go now.	Hold on.	0
What did you see?	Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?	0
Danny?	Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.	0
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.	How?	0
That's ridiculous.	He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!	0
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!	Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?	0
I don't know... Five minutes.	Good! Snipers can't be in position.	0
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.	Do you?	0
How was it?	Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.	0
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.	What'd you think?	0
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?	I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.	0
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.	You'd better before you catch the disease!	0
Is the trial date set?	Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.	0
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.	0
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.	There's no time.	0
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?	Watch your tenses.	0
What belongs to the people?	Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.	0
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.	All right, forget about it.	0
And how's your bill, Senator?	Charged.	0
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."	What's wrong with your son, anyway?	0
I'm used to you...	Never had to.	0
<u>So what are we doing</u>?	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.	0
What?	Listen, it's not erasing.	0
Hello, Leon!	Good morning, Swana.	0
Do you understand that?	Like hugging a lamp post.	0
Who were you talking to?	It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.	0
To you? In front of him?  With the...	Right?	0
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.	Will I be able to walk?	0
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?	I didn't, baby, you just told me.	0
I don't know how....	No one does till they learn....	0
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.	Really?	0
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.	Maybe she used another name.	0
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?	Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.	0
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.	You're a fuckin' liar.	0
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?	You know...like restaurants, night clubs...	0
...they sound what?	Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.	0
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!	0
I was wondering.	You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?	0
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?	Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.	0
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?	Not exactly.	0
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.	Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.	0
Just you wait!	I was here!	0
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.	You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?	0
No.	Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.	0
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.	Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.	0
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.	What's that?	0
Don't go near the bowling alley.	...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...	0
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!	It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?	0
Where will you be?	Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.	0
What is it?	Things change!	0
Hi, baby.	'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'	0
Well, you look pretty different, too.	I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.	0
Alright.	A simple yes or no would have done.	0
Please. I look a mess.	I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.	0
He knows his alphabet.	That's fine.	0
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.	0
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	Are you sure it's an opera?	0
She fell down.	Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?	0
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.	Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.	0
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.	What do you mean?	0
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.	Did you tell her?	0
But why Egypt?	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.	0
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?	Little black party dresses?	0
Hector!!	Take him.	0
Thank you.  But who sits there?	My brother's wife.	0
One more shot?	Okay.	0
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--	That's enough, Ellen.	0
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.	No.	0
I promise.	Scott?	0
Leave him alone, Tim.	Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.	0
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?	N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.	0
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."	Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.	0
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?	Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...	0
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.	Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?	0
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...	0
Will you come soon?	What time did you make it for?	0
How do you know about my mother?	I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!	0
Honey, you all right?	It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!	0
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.	So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.	0
It's stupid.	It's fun.	0
Where?	In there.	0
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.	Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.	0
What?	What the fuck am I afraid of?!	0
You work too hard, John.	Look who's talking.	0
Do what?  Oh, I see.	You're only a young thing.	0
I thought you were...	Pretty soon I'll be making a move.	0
Do I make you nervous?	With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.	0
I can't say anything!	Don't feel like nothing.	0
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?	0
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?	Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.	0
Erica.	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.	0
Oh my God. Tom.	Oh, baby, you cruel...	0
Thank you.	Thanks.	0
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.	I'm trying to help you.	0
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.	Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.	0
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.	Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.	0
Katherine.	Katherine?... Katherine who?	0
I didn't take your pills.	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.	0
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.	Was it a boyfriend of yours?	0
Wow. What a swell place to work.	Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.	0
Oh, Lord....	...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....	0
Hi.  It's me.	Where are you?	0
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.	I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.	0
Where's Ma?	Bed.	0
No. WhatÖ?	She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.	0
I can't identify him ..	He don't know that. I didn't.	0
Many happy returns of the day...	I get a party, don't I?	0
What are you talking about?	Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.	0
My therapist said that --	You're in therapy?	0
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.	The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -	0
They've got my Amado.	Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.	0
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?	He's washing down the bathroom walls.	0
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.	Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.	0
Okay.  Then what?	Then, we wait.	0
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.	Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.	0
What?	Wood or wire? They have both.	0
Do you really think I should go to the commune?	I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.	0
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?	Not very likely.	0
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.	Out!	0
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.	Where? Why?	0
Hi Walter.	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?	0
I know exactly what you mean.	How could you?	0
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.	I think you added the "brutal."	0
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...	What did you need?	0
Go away.	Give me the bat.	0
Let's drop it.	But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.	0
So you think time travel is possible? For people?	It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.	0
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.	0
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.	New York, huh?	0
Oh!	Are you alright ?	0
Make it snappy, Colonel.	There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.	0
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--	Five thirty.  Okay.	0
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.	He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.	0
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...	I like.	0
By the way, what's your name?	Pat Healy.	0
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?	In some situations.	0
2:00 A.M.	Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.	0
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?	We'll have more fun in Detroit.	0
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.	0
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?	'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.	0
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.	But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!	0
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.	Maybe she used another name.	0
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...	...closed?	0
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?	Tell me.	0
Alex, what is it?	You're sure of that?	0
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.	Well, yeah, kind of.	0
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?	Sorry... I was distracted.	0
You know how to waltz??	Itís not supposed to be anything, Kat. Itís just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I donít know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--	0
Yes, you are. You're very sick.	I know a lot more than that	0
Who's that?	Santa Claus.	0
Jon, what is it?	It tastes different.	0
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.	Elaine, what's going on?	0
No. I was just... No.	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.	0
As much as ever.  Nothing.	It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?	0
Uhh, no.	Have you been to any parties?	0
You're going to have a bachelor party?	Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?	0
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.	Big-ass titties?	0
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...	They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.	0
No!	That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.	0
They're not here.	Whatiya mean?	0
Want a hit?	Can we order first?	0
