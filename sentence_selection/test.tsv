Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me óó	This has nothing to do with that.	0
Jon, where are we?	Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.	0
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?	Yes, Swana, you did.	0
So who...?	We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.	0
What's that?	They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...	0
Do you mean that?	And I was wondering.	0
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.	"Some"?	0
What?	Where would they be going?	0
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.	What is that he's working on?	0
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.	You want your jewelry?	0
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.	Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.	0
Yes.	What's inside?	0
I thought you might want some hot coffee.	Thanks just the same.	0
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.	Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.	0
The King pipeline.	I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.	0
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.	He's in interrogation?	0
No. I'm the exact opposite --	That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.	0
Are those for me?	No, they're for your mom.	0
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.	No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.	0
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...	Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.	0
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.	Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.	0
Stupid.	When your husband get hit by the bus?	0
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.	What can I do for you?	0
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?	No reason at all, darlin'.	0
wasn't even thinking about-	No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?	0
Caesar, what are we going to do?	I can't help what I think.	0
What do you mean?	They don't notice that kind of thing.	0
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.	So Suzie, you called us, remember?	0
No.	That's frustrating.	0
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.	I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.	0
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?	Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?	0
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.	Is that so? You might marry me?	0
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?	Well it's fucking time.	0
No, I want my cut!	I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.	0
Those are cold.	Warm them up.	0
Me?	Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.	0
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.	How do you know that?	0
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.	Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.	0
They had to kill 'em?	Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.	0
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.	Lena?	0
Is it because I'm here?	What do you think?	0
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.	Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.	0
Oh-	This is the first book that I got you.	0
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.	Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.	0
What?	Where you lived with them.	0
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.	Let me come in.	0
Why?!	The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.	0
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.	No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?	0
I understand the business reasons.	Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.	0
Do you have a name?	He'll, what else can I do with it all?	0
It would be a nice change from you.	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.	0
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.	Growing. I'm glad you said that.	0
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.	Is that the fish you won at the carnival?	0
I couldn't help it óó I loved him.	What-	0
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...	I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --	0
No -- only occasional jobs.	Tired?	0
I just can't have any social life right now.	Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.	0
Oh, no. You'll muss me.	Why, yes.  Thank you.	0
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?	You look at me as though I had said something foolish...	0
Can't sleep?	In and out.	0
That's right.	...and therafore there is no consequence?	0
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.	Do you know who was brought in for questioning?	0
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."	I said that's enough!	0
I'm sorry.	We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.	0
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.	You're looking for a bomb.	0
Could you get this? I can't	Sure.	0
I can't believe you did that!	Looking for a job.	0
Did you know? Had you heard?	She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.	0
Yeah?	I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-	0
Where are we going?	Maybe.	0
Your boy.	Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...	0
You're damn right I'm serious....	I'm just getting started....	0
Uh-uh-why?	I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.	0
Tuesday.	Where'd you get that dress?	0
Hey, I don't believe it.	Hiya, kid.	0
He was an Indo-pacific.	Just part of life on the road, peanut.	0
That was a great idea, Shorty.	I told you it would taste just like chicken.	0
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.	On one condition...	0
She could've been a nurse.	You see your office?	0
And this is how he came to the boat?	Oh my God.	0
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.	Maybe.	0
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancÈ's in Palermo.	Yeah?	0
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!	Value? ... Value?	0
What?	Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.	0
Terry, for God's sake.	Get out of my way.	0
And she waited here for him?	It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.	0
So...	So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.	0
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.	I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.	0
Ok.	Alright?	0
Where's the bloody -	You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...	0
Are you going down?	I don't know.	0
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.	And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?	0
Since I was a child, Iíve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnít rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.	I ought to smack your face!	0
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?	You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.	0
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!	She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!	0
Why?	Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.	0
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...	It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...	0
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.	I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?	0
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.	Thank you...	0
I love you.	It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.	0
Go right ahead.	Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?	0
Hey, Joel --	What did you tell him?	0
What are you going to do?	I loved you, Madeleine.	0
It's hard to describe.	Heaven knows. A lot.	0
She used those words?	Mama, no.	0
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.	See, I wouldn't think that about you.	0
I shouldn't.	Will you marry me?	0
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --	So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --	0
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?	Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.	0
You killed them.	It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.	0
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?	We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.	0
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?	Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.	0
So you're like... struggling superheroes?	We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...	0
Thank you, sir.	And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?	0
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.	You couldn't.	0
They can look forward to that.	The bay doesn't.	0
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.	What's in it?	0
These appointments were not my idea, remember.	This happened to you?	0
Yes.	I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?	0
What's wrong?	They're killing the Wigand interview...	0
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.	Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?	0
Where will you live?	Sean --	0
What is it, Johnnie?	Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...	0
What about The Club ... ?	Let me worry about The Club ...	0
What's that?	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.	0
Doesn't your foot hurt?	I can't feel a thing, Hon.	0
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--	Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!	0
That's silly.	I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?	0
What about the raping?	Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.	0
To kill me?	I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnít come close to how bad it is. Bye now.	0
I'm sure.	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?	0
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!	Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.	0
Ten years ago.	One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.	0
What?  Like amnesia?	Like hugging a lamp post.	0
Then what are you scared of, honey?	I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.	0
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..	Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.	0
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.	0
Oh--no, no!	I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.	0
You knew my daddy?	Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...	0
But Richard, no, I, I --	-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?	0
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.	I know.	0
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this tooó don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.	Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.	0
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.	Nah.  Don't sweat it.	0
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!	Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.	0
Excellency!	Madame. How can I help you?	0
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	You're not selfish at all.	0
No, you weren't	The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.	0
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?	Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.	0
Pat's an architect, too.	Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?	0
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."	Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?	0
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.	Just go.  We can manage without you.	0
They'll mend.	What about your husband?	0
And I actually date you?	Something wrong?	0
Don't you think he trusts us together?	Little ones.	0
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...	Could they be the miners?	0
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.	His will.	0
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.	0
Thank you, Louis.	Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.	0
To have a good time with you until you have to go.	Where is she?	0
Thank you.	You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?	0
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.	Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.	0
Oh, all right.	No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?	0
Can I help you, sir?	I think so, daughter.  How old are you?	0
Where?	Life.	0
We're not interested.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.	0
I don't understand...	Play it! Come on!	0
No.	What's that?	0
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.	I think I'll do what I damn well please.	0
How?	I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --	0
That's the third time he's called today.	He wants me to break a leg?	0
What?	This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?	0
Why?	I don't know.	0
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.	The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...	0
Cole?	Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.	0
Sure.	You fuckin' whore!	0
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...	... and Karen.	0
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!	Stop the car!  Now!!	0
No, sir, those are... redbirds.	The sign says strawberry finches.	0
I can't do it. What's the point?	Who?	0
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.	Yes, Betty.	0
Loretta.	Where'd Johnny find you?	0
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?	What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?	0
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?	All I want's the money.	0
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.	We can look out for ourselves.	0
Yes.	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?	0
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!	Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?	0
Who?	Yeah let's hear about your day.	0
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?	Collision? With what?	0
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?	0
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!	Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.	0
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.	Not now, Elaine!	0
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.	I don't smoke.	0
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.	Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.	0
Just a few minutes ago.	Oh.  You look so beautiful.	0
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.	Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.	0
I've come to a decision.	Oh.	0
Sam, Tony, come in here.	Hey, I'm not dressed.	0
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?	Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.	0
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.	0
Don't forget your identity.	I'll be all right.	0
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.	[Beat] We will.	0
What about Grace?	You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.	0
She jumped out of the window.	I know. Where is he, I said.	0
What things?	Butt-munch.	0
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?	Too difficult?	0
What is it now?	Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.	0
Is it deep?	I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.	0
No, stay.  Please stay with me.	Honey, I gotta start makin' money.	0
I went to the movies.	What'd you see?	0
You know who.	Please.	0
-- where? -	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.	0
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!	And how the hell are we going to do that?	0
Are you a bad boy?	Whatiya mean?	0
Oh, Paul--	You're married!  You've already got a husband!	0
--but you're father's in there!	What's he do?	0
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.	Like a woman of mystery.	0
You may do that in the privacy of your room.	Okay. I'll take a half hour.	0
...like the water purifiers?	I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.	0
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.	So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?	0
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.	Really, I don't know enough about it to...	0
Darn clever, these Armenians.	Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.	0
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?	Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?	0
My ass is falling.  It is.	What are you talking about?	0
I don't think that's funny.	It wasn't meant to be.	0
What are you looking for?	I don't know	0
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.	Oh, sorry -	0
No, on the porch.	Fiendishly so.	0
Is that a problem?	Sorry.	0
Yeah.	Yep.  Eloped.	0
I'm not gonna let that happen.	I'm going to see you get that chance.	0
Good morning, my lord!	Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!	0
What would you do up here?	Look. Talk. Not talk.	0
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?	I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --	0
Do you still have that doctor's number?	Sort of.	0
You play all these places?	Baker's unabridged.	0
I want mine to wear glasses.	There are things you know for sure.	0
Yeah what?!	Really? That was fast.	0
Yeah, no kidding.	-- mmm --	0
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.	We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.	0
He was upset with moving, I believe.	Is that all he said?	0
Oh, thank you, sir.	Do any pupils come to the house?	0
I can't open it.	It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...	0
...Who is this?	Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.	0
Right.	No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.	0
Can't we at least talk about it?	No.  Doris.	0
I was told you were in a fight.	Yes, ma'am.	0
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!	Itís Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?	0
How many times you gonna tell me that?	As many times as it takes.	0
We? Don't blame me!	To who?	0
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.	Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.	0
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!	Hey, that's super	0
Well, there's got to be a way...	Have you got a cigarette?	0
Right. See how your story ends.	Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?	0
It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh	0
Lotte, this is so good...	Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.	0
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.	But Rennie...	0
What?	My mind's not on guessing games.	0
No.	Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!	0
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.	They believe in the 'TULIP.'	0
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.	How like her.	0
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...	0
Shut the door, shut the door!	Oh, I'm sorry.	0
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.	It's ok if you are.	0
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?	Don't think that'd be wise.	0
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --	Try not to think about it.	0
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.	Because life is good.	0
Caesar, maybe we should run --	No.  Not yet.	0
Itís the past. Itís nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then letís go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.	I slept with your sister.	0
Beloved husband...	Second word... sound like 'dance'.	0
Who lives?	See, I'm new.	0
Ha!	What?	0
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.	Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.	0
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.	She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.	0
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.	You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.	0
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!	Penny--?!  Are you all right?	0
What universe are you in, Paul?	A quantum one.	0
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.	This ain't no photo.	0
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.	Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.	0
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.	Could be risky.	0
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.	Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.	0
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?	I guess that means it's okay.	0
--You're a cop.	Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.	0
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.	Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.	0
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?	0
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?	Uh, if the guy wants to.	0
It's more like a date.	It's a long way to go for a date.	0
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.	Thank you...	0
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.	Sure... I'll see you around.	0
Where'd you leave 'em?	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...	0
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?	Nope.	0
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --	-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.	0
She hated you --	Well, she had problems --	0
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?	Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, weíll go back to the real world and...and youíll be hiring me for your best friend!	0
Last I heard he went to San Diego.	If we went there, would you be able to find him?	0
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?	Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.	0
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!	There's always another girl.	0
I have?	I saw them.	0
Well! Nothing like experimenting.	I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.	0
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.	You wouldn't be a widow long.	0
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --	Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --	0
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.	What, leaving school...	0
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?	0
Never!  I'm going in and ask himó	If you do, I'll break your neck.	0
I could help you.  I could get you off that.	You don't have to do it for a living.	0
Boy, this is good!	I'm sorry that I became so upset.	0
What should I do? Call the cops?	You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.	0
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?	I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.	0
Why do you look at me like that?	I did not know you were so beautiful... and --	0
What's in Big Sur?	That's where Valentine's scarpered.	0
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?	The National Safety Council would be appalled.	0
Set!	Now!	0
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.	Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?	0
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...	Really? What is it he's writing?	0
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.	A homo?	0
Hello there. Howís the flat. I cleaned...	Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Iíd given you and then got back, remember? I canít find it. Do you know where it is?	0
What are you doing with all these blueprints?	Yeah.	0
Is he leaving right this minute?	No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.	0
Just lucky, I guess.	You're upset about losing the whales.	0
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.	The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --	0
I'm sorry.	One.	0
I've got to think of Emily -	I'd like to talk to you about that.	0
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.	I could take after Dad, too.	0
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.	It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?	0
Two hundred years old.	To Oz!	0
You want some company?	Sure.	0
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.	No, Iím serious...youíre really stunning...	0
It was nobody's fault.	But John was with him at the pool?	0
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.	Hey, don't be ridiculous.	0
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.	Sure, hon.	0
Can you do that?	I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?	0
I'll be back in 137 hours.	Have fun.	0
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:	All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.	0
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.	Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.	0
No.	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.	0
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!	I hate sports.	0
You talk to Carl ?	The refridgerator.	0
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, weíre the past. Iím not sure if you noticed, but Iím here with someone else.	Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereís something not quite right.	0
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...	Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.	0
You're hurting me.	Floating to Catalina.	0
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.	Abby--	0
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?	You probably got the idea.	0
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.	A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...	0
So where is he?	I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.	0
What was that?	Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.	0
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.	I won't.	0
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!	What?	0
He's a very private person, actually.	Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.	0
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softósoap twenty editors!	Lex is going bye-bye.	0
I can take care of myself.  You know that.	I know...I know.	0
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.	Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?	0
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?	No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.	0
I'm scared.	Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.	0
Is it December?	How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.	0
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?	More than 800,000 years.	0
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.	I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.	0
You promised!	No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.	0
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?	I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.	0
No.	Was he unfaithful?	0
Symington says...	Sedate her.	0
Did that help? Did you learn anything?	We established that we have no communication.	0
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.	Where?	0
Okay, Jason, your move.	What?	0
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.	What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?	0
A flare?	I've got a present for you...	0
...I'm sorry.	Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.	0
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.	Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.	0
Are they going to work here too?	Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.	0
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?	It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.	0
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?	Like the quiche?	0
Can we chance moving him?	Why certainly!	0
But why?	That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.	0
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --	Jeffrey.	0
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?	Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.	0
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.	There are two bodies found at this point.	0
So do I.	I love you Sally.	0
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.	Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.	0
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.	I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?	0
I'm from a small town too, you know.	Run!	0
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!	Then you're as single as I am.	0
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?	Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.	0
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?	Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.	0
Aren't you going to get that?	Am I interrupting anything?	0
Then who flushed the toilet?	Father's friend.	0
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!	Jess, c'mon...	0
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.	There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?	0
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?	I'm through improvising.	0
I don't think we have anything to talk about.	How can you tell that -- from here?	0
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?	Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.	0
Moreover...	Thank you, Rose.	0
That this was going to be a key party?	Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.	0
Well, it's over.	But I feel likeó My friends won't talk to me.	0
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.	Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.	0
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.	Was I?	0
You fucked with me for the last time!	Okay, yeah.	0
How long you been up, you need a nap.	Due in Nashville.	0
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.	I hope that it's nothing serious.	0
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?	0
You...	Tomorrow.	0
No, Mikey.	Yes.	0
I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.	0
Can I bring Kenny?	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?	0
Me?	I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.	0
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.	I don't want your help.	0
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...	Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...	0
That's the way he is.	Yeah. It's just like I figured.	0
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.	Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.	0
Then we'll be safe?	Yeah.	0
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.	At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.	0
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?	Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...	0
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.	Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.	0
That's Skid Row... isn't it?	I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?	0
Just do it.	Okay, okay.	0
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.	Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.	0
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.	I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.	0
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.	Dr. Dreyfuss.	0
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.	Tell me about Frank Ligourin.	0
No! Why are you haunting me?	Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.	0
Who's them Blue Men yonder?	Blue men.	0
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.	Nurse! Help !	0
They just left, didn't they?	I know, Mother.	0
It isn't?	Marylin? When did I say...?	0
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?	A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.	0
It's temporary.	Yes...	0
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?	Call me.	0
C'mon, kids, let's go.	You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?	0
Get him!	Let me jingle you right now.	0
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.	Funny.  I never did.	0
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...	He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.	0
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --	She may be later than you think...	0
Yes.	For what?	0
I have to go home and get my things.	He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.	0
Colwyn ...	Where is the Fortress?	0
How often you go?	Dozen times a day.	0
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?	Why should I help that old fuck.	0
No Mac, please... I --	How charming.  But why did he not come himself?	0
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.	Very well, I'll watch.	0
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.	No.	0
You're a fag or a liar.	The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Iím a talking head.	0
...no...	Who?	0
Do you always drive like this?	Yes.	0
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --	At least you have a mother.	0
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?	What?	0
Very.	Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"	0
What does he look like?	You might be disappointed.	0
Does it?	Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.	0
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?	There's someone in the house.	0
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --	How beautiful.	0
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.	0
So what is it?	No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!	0
Sheís pretty... See you, huh?	That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.	0
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -	What's that supposed to mean?	0
That woman was a student of yours?	You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...	0
Yes.	I'm going to the store. You need anything?	0
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?	Sylvan can be talked into anything.	0
I'm sorry... are you okay?	I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.	0
I may spill something.	So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.	0
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.	What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?	0
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?	No more stalling, Captain.	0
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.	Is the dizziness gone?	0
With Jennifer.	And where'd you go?	0
He said he worked there --	No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?	0
And is Foley a part of this?	He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.	0
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.	I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.	0
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.	No hard feelings?	0
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.	What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?	0
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.	This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.	0
She's watching the car again?	Yeah.	0
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..	Never.	0
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.	Not really...  what's this?	0
Pity.	Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.	0
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...	Well done you.	0
I want your feelings about it.	I try.	0
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.	They must have turned him down.	0
I'll hurry back.	It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.	0
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?	You're not the only one...	0
Our Lord said just the opposite.	Oh, who cares?	0
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.	I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.	0
Ah, but, we're asking about you.	I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.	0
I insist you get rid of that bomb.	I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.	0
What does that mean?	... what?...	0
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.	I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!	0
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.	I am.  Really.  It was awesome.	0
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?	You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.	0
Do you have a girlfriend?	Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....	0
Can I get you a drink?	Black market during the war.	0
Yes, I am.	No, you're not.	0
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.	He needs me, ma'am.	0
Like what?	Like me.	0
Yes, Senator--*twice*.	Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?	0
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.	Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?	0
Thank you.	Well don't thank me, because I want you to.	0
Who?	Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.	0
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.	"There's more light here," he says--	0
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.	I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.	0
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?	Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...	0
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.	Maybe I'm just on vacation.	0
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...	What's his name?	0
Yes!	I gotta go to work.	0
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.	I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.	0
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.	0
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.	Naw, in the ring, a dive is-	0
I had a good time tonight.	I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.	0
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--	--my number one fan.	0
Ted!  What are you...?	Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --	0
Heard about it. Just never seen it.	Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.	0
They wouldn't?	no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?	0
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?	Did you mail then?	0
Whose?	That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?	0
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?	0
So you found Peter...	I think we sort of found each other.	0
You look tired....	I'm wearing it.	0
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.	When?	0
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.	And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.	0
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.	What's that--detour?	0
He does. Could we have a table close to him?	And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.	0
John Steed.	The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.	0
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.	You're too clean for me.	0
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.	The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?	0
Is it?	Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?	0
It was going to be a surprise!	That was nothing. That wasn't anything.	0
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.	Did you.  What was that in aid of?	0
Why don't you see Lester?	If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.	0
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --	... All right.	0
Did something happen; are you alright?	But I get what I want, always, don't I?	0
She's an editor.	I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.	0
What happened?	Eh, if the bootie fits...	0
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...	Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.	0
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.	I don't know.	0
I don't give a damn about the gold.	Every year.	0
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?	Oh, this is wonderful...	0
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.	That's real big of you.	0
What are you doing here?	God, well don't let him go! Catch him!	0
I don't like starlings.	Why not?	0
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?	C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.	0
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.	I'm sorry, I don't understand.	0
He's good, isn't he?	I can't be staying long anyway.	0
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.	Nice job.	0
I buy that. What about him?	He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.	0
He might have hurt somebody.	But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.	0
The Wizard of Gore?	Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.	0
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.	Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?	0
Oh Christ.	Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?	0
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.	Yes.	0
Tuesday.	Got here as soon as I could.	0
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?	0
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.	Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?	0
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.	Is she home?	0
Please --	I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.	0
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...	Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.	0
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.	Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!	0
You win. It's--Clarissa.	Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--	0
He do that every year?	Every year.	0
You're lying.	No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.	0
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?	A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.	0
Yes, sir.	All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?	0
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.	I wouldn't go so far as to say that.	0
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?	We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --	0
How do I load?	Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....	0
I had a... salad.	Yeah... I'd like that.	0
I will, David!	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.	0
I need to know that.	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.	0
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.	I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.	0
Then why are you so upset?	Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.	0
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.	Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.	0
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.	You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.	0
Well, not much longer to go.	You just move in here?	0
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...	Can you follow simple directions?	0
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.	So am I.	0
I want to know.	óand those and them.	0
And you will come to hear us tonight?	My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?	0
I know.	Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.	0
I'm saying they came into my yard.	You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?	0
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.	I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?	0
What is that?	Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.	0
What?	It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.	0
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.	No!!!!!	0
Please let me go.	All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --	0
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.	Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.	0
Hello?	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.	0
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...	Oh man, that's just great...	0
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.	Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --	0
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?	No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.	0
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?	I told you you wouldn't like him.	0
Do you have something to prove?	Not in that repressed anger sort of way.	0
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.	Make out with you for free.	0
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.	0
We discussed that.  And decided not to.	Why not?	0
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.	I guess so.	0
Let's try a little harder, shall we?	Will you give me a break?	0
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-	I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...	0
And you knew he'd be here.	Under a cloud without cause, I take it.	0
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.	No, I mean doing it at my house.	0
Better person than I.	Hi.	0
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.	Will you marry me?	0
...Certain people are --	Do what?	0
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --	There may be things you'd rather not know about.	0
Why should I?	Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.	0
Nicholas...	Be sorry for nothing.	0
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?	Yep.	0
Have you heard of a French film called ìLa Collectionooseî?	La what?	0
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.	He has a computer?	0
No. The little one.	Eli. Why can't you remember their names?	0
That we swim.	Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.	0
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.	I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.	0
I know, but that's enough.	You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?	0
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.	Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.	0
Awaiting his arrival.	How'd they get it inside?	0
Hey Sandy.	-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --	0
But I'm not.	I'm not either!!	0
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...	Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...	0
I want it understood.	Yes ma'am.	0
That's a simple subject.	It's the heat.	0
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.	Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.	0
I want to go home.	Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.	0
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...	Tell me.	0
What's that?	A present I picked up for you.	0
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.	This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.	0
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?	Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.	0
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.	How?	0
Why?	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.	0
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.	Justin?	0
I thought you were one of my friends.	I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>	0
I'm sorry.	You don't mean?	0
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.	Party?  Oh no, I canít go to a party...	0
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?	I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?	0
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.	What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?	0
Could we sit down someplace?	I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.	0
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....	I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.	0
Ah, let me have a little fun.	Please!	0
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.	0
I hope so	Do me another favor?	0
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.	To his hotel?	0
But then I had a brother and a sister left.	So had I.	0
What did you just say?	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.	0
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.	Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.	0
Oh, for goodness' sake!	Thank you.	0
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.	Too late.  Just my luck.	0
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.	It couldn't have been.	0
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?	True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?	0
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?	You weren't supposed to leave her alone.	0
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?	Where's June today?	0
Not to me.	Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --	0
-- we are?	Hi Vada, can you come out?	0
Yes, I would!	Get out of here.	0
I hope so.	I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.	0
Did not.	Did to.	0
You can stop right there.	We spent a night there one night...	0
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!	Vivian, what the --	0
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.	I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.	0
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?	Let it go.	0
They did?	Take your time.	0
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.	In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.	0
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?	He's out.	0
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?	She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.	0
Here we are.	Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?	0
Elliot!  Don't!	She said what you said she'd say.	0
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?	Peanut butter.	0
Can't.	Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.	0
What are you wearing?	Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.	0
You could have infected him, isn't that right?	Sue... look at your hands.	0
Done what?	Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.	0
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?	Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.	0
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --	There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --	0
That's just the way I am!	Let HER ask.	0
No one will know your name.	Can you say that my name is Jack?	0
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...	It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.	0
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.	About seventeen days.	0
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.	My bed.	0
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.	Why?  'Cause you know him?	0
And I can't leave.	If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.	0
No, no, that's fine.	I know, it sucks!	0
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.	0
Near the casino.	And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?	0
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?	Standing right here in my office.	0
It relaxes me.	Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.	0
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.	It's a diet thing?	0
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.	That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.	0
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?	I'll try.	0
The Big Boy did...?	That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	0
Oh, please.	If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.	0
Go ahead.	What's going to happen when you release the whales?	0
That's probably good.	Groceries maybe? A package?	0
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"	You get off on abuse or something?	0
What did it want?	That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.	0
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?	And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.	0
You just feel sorry for me.	Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.	0
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?	Everything's so simple. I like you.	0
That's none of your business.	This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.	0
Yes?	Looks like today's your lucky day	0
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?	Yes.	0
-- is that what this is all about?	Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.	0
You've been here before?	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.	0
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -	Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -	0
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!	Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.	0
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --	This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.	0
Thank you.	I should have -	0
Do I look okay?	Nothing.	0
Youíve always got that to hide behind, donít you? Itís just business!	Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, weíll go back to the real world and...and youíll be hiring me for your best friend!	0
The biggest waste of time since television.	Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?	0
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.	But he's--	0
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?	No--not much--excepting--	0
A man wouldn't do that...	This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!	0
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?	Yes, I would.	0
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.	We did our best, Comrade.	0
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!	Why doesn't it never work out?	0
He's very human.	Me?	0
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	0
You really don't need anyone?	No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.	0
Doc...	Lily.	0
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.	Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.	0
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.	The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.	0
I'm ready for a complicated man.	--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.	0
Could we talk about that a little later?	Yeah.	0
You look... different.	I do?	0
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?	I can run out and get it.	0
Find the bird cage?	Some committee's got it.	0
Don't be silly. Of course you can.	I'm telling you, I can't.	0
I didn't run away. I left the flat.	Not a one.	0
Hiding?	Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?	0
No...	Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.	0
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.	Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.	0
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.	Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.	0
And certainly pretty.	Do you expect me to believe...?	0
They're coming!	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.	0
No.	If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.	0
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...	Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.	0
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."	Don't make it less true.	0
Yeah but I'm serious.	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...	0
Beaumont Livingston.	I knew it.	0
I spaced out.	So what?	0
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?	Thorazin.	0
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.	They can use their imaginations.	0
Do you sing and dance?	...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.	0
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?	I'm not going anywhere.	0
...you don't even know what you're looking for.	Yeah, like...	0
Do you really want this, Dick?	This.  Above all.	0
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.	That's lame, isn't it?	0
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.	He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.	0
Did I say that?	How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.	0
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.	No they're not.	0
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.	It's the only way.	0
I don't remember.	Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?	0
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.	Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.	0
Mommy's sick, guys.	Judy --	0
My daddy likes me home before dark.	Where is it? I want it.	0
It's not mine.	It's not mine either.	0
You flatter, my lord.	No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.	0
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.	You ought to get rid of those dogs.	0
Should I whistle down a cab?	Two.	0
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?	Don't make no difference no more.	0
And is that it?	Kept us warm for twelve years.	0
Really?	That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.	0
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?	No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.	0
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.	Oh, I can think of a million things -	0
You going there?	Yeah--why--	0
How come youíre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?	Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.	0
God, Dana's going to kill you!	...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?	0
Out to lunch with the girls.	It's perfect.	0
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'	No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.	0
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?	Why what?	0
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.	I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.	0
How long do we have to wait here?	Well -- until the policeman whistles again.	0
You and 'Honey'?	I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.	0
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?	Alma Wetzel.	0
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.	Forgive me for trying to be nice.	0
And this gives worth to butchery?	I think that's what I'm saying.	0
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.	Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...	0
Owe you what?	You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!	0
But you don't mind.	I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.	0
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...	No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.	0
Anger. Rage. Frustration.	Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...	0
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!	Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?	0
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.	Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.	0
Good strategy.	I don't think we should get into that.	0
He is dead now, twenty years.	It opens, too. Look inside.	0
Instantly.	This is April, right?	0
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--	--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?	0
Promise.	Promises mean nothing.	0
Yeah.	You did this once it didn't work out.	0
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.	She took my head.	0
Still looking.	That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.	0
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?	I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.	0
You knew he was coming.	No.	0
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.	The goddamn smell is always the same.	0
Ió I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.	Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.	0
When?	I'm serious, Frances. This is important.	0
You are a therapist, right?	Why?	0
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.	0
Who do?	You do.	0
Lights out, Sam.	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?	0
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --	Bet you're happy to be working again.	0
Wow. You believe in me that much--	Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.	0
Then what? My boobs are too big?	Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --	0
Kalen...	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.	0
Is there some reason why you're here?	Me?	0
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?	I'm not armed.  Well?	0
I don't know, Mulder.	And where are they going with it?	0
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.	0
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?	Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...	0
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.	Tell us about it.	0
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.	We don't know that --	0
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.	Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!	0
You're as bad as Harry...	No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?	0
That's an affirmative.	Keep your eyes open.	0
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.	I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.	0
Disease? What disease?	A cure?	0
Ask a question, you get an answer!..	Damn, you're beautiful.	0
Your secretary, huh!	Y'know what?	0
1922. Why the kippers?	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?	0
Well, then what are you doing here?	I... do you want me to leave?	0
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.	I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.	0
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?	I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.	0
Still the man.	Yup.	0
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.	A special friend?	0
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.	What the hell is that?	0
She lives here too?	Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....	0
Oh!	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.	0
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.	And what's that?	0
Oh yes! In Muncie!	'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.	0
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?	Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?	0
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -	Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.	0
Hello?	I thought I told you not to answer the phone.	0
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'	Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.	0
Daddy!	Okay, this is working.	0
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!	Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereís something not quite right.	0
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.	Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.	0
Am I a prisoner?	That's not the way we look at it.	0
Right... You have a boat.	We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.	0
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.	Are you finished?	0
You're acting like a crazy person.	Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?	0
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.	What?	0
You don't think I know?	You can drop the act, itís over.	0
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?	Yes...	0
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.	Wow. You don't fool around, do you?	0
You got it, stud.	I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.	0
Something happened with Marty and Ray--	Abby...	0
What are you doing?	My life is a living hell.	0
I...	I have an idea.	0
Walter, you can't do that!	Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."	0
Do you think it goes all the way across?	One way to find out.	0
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.	No.	0
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.	I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?	0
You really came back for more?  Of this?	It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.	0
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.	No.	0
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."	Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.	0
No.	What?	0
You're charming the boy.	Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.	0
There's always an excuse, isn't there?	How much time do you have?	0
What?	Come with me then.	0
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?	Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.	0
The fuck you been doin' to me?	And who's Claude?	0
Look at all that silverware.	I don't believe you have "things."	0
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.	0
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.	Where are you, anyway?	0
And the bad news?	Look, the ice is melting.	0
Why would anyone do this?	You know any good criminal lawyers?	0
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?	You're talking nonsense.	0
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.	The car broke down.	0
Yeah.	You lost your mom...	0
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.	Never mind.	0
Wonder where we'll be then.	Yes, I am rather.	0
Yes, I did.	... Well?	0
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!	0
Because when we get down there --	And leave me down here???	0
I got the quick-and-ugly version.	Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.	0
I'm tired. I want to go home.	Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...	0
That her?	Yeah.	0
By pulling my hair?!	I was all out of dynamite!	0
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.	That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?	0
I might have an idea...	We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.	0
I can't.	It's fine really, sit.	0
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?	Not for a moment.	0
Sheís your dog, Jack.	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.	0
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.	Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.	0
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.	If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.	0
Frank...what's wrong?	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.	0
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.	It was pretty bad, huh?	0
Then you're safer in here.	Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.	0
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.	I can't.	0
And that's it?	If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.	0
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.	Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?	0
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!	Insolent young cub!	0
What did you do?	Yeah.	0
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?	Now don't that call for an extra!	0
-- and take this with you.	The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.	0
Who is she?	I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.	0
Isn't there something called group hysteria?	You think you influenced her?	0
No?	Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.	0
Oh.  Congratulations.	We live together now.	0
What? What do you stand for?	Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?	0
Bravo!	But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.	0
What's left of my blood.	Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?	0
Oh, yeah?	And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.	0
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?	.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.	0
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.	I laugh sometimes	0
Hey! Ethan!	Hmmm?	0
You got a bet on the game tonight?	As a matter of fact, I do.	0
I have to go ó-	But you're happy here -- you like your work ó-	0
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.	Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.	0
Diz--	Yeah.	0
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.	0
We had a good laugh, didn't we?	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.	0
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?	I don't think you understand the full implications of --	0
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.	I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.	0
Copy. And Lundegaard too.	Yah. Where are ya, Margie?	0
Go back to sleep.	I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.	0
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.	His will.	0
You won't go to the police if I tell you?	You asked me if I would --	0
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.	Can you move over a wee bit?	0
K... Cross.	That your maiden name?	0
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.	Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?	0
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?	I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.	0
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.	It's not important.	0
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.	0
I've never been to Louisville.	Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.	0
How can you just take the plane like this?	Thanks, I like it.  I think.	0
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?	Why me?	0
Honey, you all right?	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.	0
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?	Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?	0
I'll stay.	You know what we ought to do tonight?	0
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.	Erin. I'll always be with you.	0
Did she do that to you, too?	No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.	0
Who's left out there?	Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.	0
How's work?	Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?	0
What's it about?	A priest who dies.	0
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?	You could leave him.	0
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.	I'll say she is!	0
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!	Yes.	0
Oh yeah.	It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?	0
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.	Come on, gal...	0
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?	No.	0
Shelly's already told me all about sex.	She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.	0
It's everybody's problem!	Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.	0
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.	That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --	0
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?	0
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.	You're over reacting!	0
Let's just walk, okay?	Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.	0
God, you smell like whiskey.	No, no, I have to talk to you.	0
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.	Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.	0
Okay, then.	Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.	0
I love you, Austin.	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.	0
I can't.	You have to.	0
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.	We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.	0
What difference does it make?	Is Ray going?	0
I'm nervous.	Trust me. Don't be nervous.	0
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.	0
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.	I killed him!  I killed him!	0
You're doing a murder case?	Nothing.	0
It's just for verification through the credit card company.	-- and this is confidential?	0
So what went wrong?	I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.	0
Oh no...	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.	0
That's the Farren house.	Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.	0
You gave them the eight billion.	You mean the seven billion.	0
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.	It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.	0
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.	Where were you?	0
Thank you.	Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.	0
Yeah.	They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...	0
Hurray!	Where do we go from here?	0
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?	Thank you...	0
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.	Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!	0
What does that mean?	Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.	0
Should I whistle down a cab?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?	0
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?	Good fighters.	0
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.	Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...	0
So what's going on, Joel?	I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.	0
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.	Yeah, you will.  Of course.	0
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?	Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.	0
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.	I was?	0
And--	He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.	0
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--	It has nothing to do with--	0
Do you like that?	Not in that repressed anger sort of way.	0
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.	I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...	0
That horrible woman!	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.	0
Will you meet with him?	Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?	0
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.	What?	0
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.	Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.	0
Too late now.	Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.	0
Don't start --	Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.	0
You're intolerable today.	Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.	0
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?	Looking for you.	0
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?	I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.	0
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.	We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.	0
There's been an accident, Truman.	Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.	0
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.	Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...	0
Oh yeah?	-- Mr. Lindgren.	0
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.	They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.	0
You should know how it works.  Just in case.	Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.	0
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.	Well -- until the policeman whistles again.	0
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?	The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?	0
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.	How did you know?	0
Molested little girls?	Yeah.	0
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.	Margo? Lunching in public?	0
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.	Just sit back and enjoy the show.	0
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.	Oh no. He said that.	0
Eeuch !	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.	0
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...	Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?	0
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.	For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.	0
Oh, yeah, really, oh!	I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.	0
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.	He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.	0
I don't know.	When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.	0
This rope is sixty years old!	We're way past inappropriate.	0
I'm sorry.	Oh, you did? I didn't know that.	0
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?	All the time.	0
Just now.	My God. I haven't seen you since...	0
I thought we were meeting here.	I'm here with Jenny.	0
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!	0
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother	Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.	0
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.	Thank you.	0
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.	No dog.	0
Fifteen years?	Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.	0
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?	Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?	0
In the house.  I was scared.	Did you call the police?	0
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.	I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.	0
What's you name?	Ethan Hunt.	0
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.	He did run?	0
You're sure?  There was nothing?	I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.	0
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.	I know what it means.	0
What?	They killed him. They threw him out that window.	0
It is fifty years since I heard that name.	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.	0
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.	I just picked them up on the way over...	0
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.	0
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.	Whether crabs are in season there now...	0
You're trembling.	It's okay. I'm alright.	0
And do you like it that way?	Not really.	0
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute...	0
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!	So where would we go?	0
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...	Oh, right.  Sorry.	0
Well it's nice that you were there for her.	I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...	0
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.	Five, six-hundred thousand.	0
Creepy guy.	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?	0
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?	No.	0
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.	And Laszlo?	0
That's a good one, coming from you.	I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.	0
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.	I had training. In the Republic.	0
What?!	So would I.  But it's not mine to give.	0
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.	0
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.	Shut up!	0
Oh, okay. Like this.	You've never been to a dance, have you?	0
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.	Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.	0
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.	I can't, it's yours.	0
Oh my God.	What?	0
I'd love to.	Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.	0
Yes.	What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?	0
Yeah?	I'd like to... take you out or something.	0
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?	This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --	0
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --	Why don't we say we were together?	0
But the setup's there. It's there now.	I found them in your file box.	0
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.	I know.	0
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.	You can sleep tomorrow... come on...	0
Let the law --	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.	0
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.	You ain't seen nothin.	0
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.	Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.	0
So make an exception.	No.	0
Ollie.	Business folks.	0
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.	There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?	0
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.	Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.	0
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.	All right, let's go.	0
I love the way she writes.	What?	0
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?	Slavers capture them and bring them here.	0
Yeah, Earl Warren?	Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.	0
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?	0
Who?	Guess.	0
No one has ever done anything like this.	For you.	0
What did he have to do -ó look at the body?	I asked what <u>you</u> thought.	0
Why always on this night?	Why'd you go into business with him?	0
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.	There've been some calls.	0
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --	Good.	0
I can't find my ball.	Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?	0
Oh?	I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.	0
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.	No, it was open. It wasn't locked.	0
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!	That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?	0
You see what you're doing, don't you?	What am I doing?	0
Who was it?	Just get your clothes on...	0
Oh my God!	I mean, that worked out.	0
Where're you going?	Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.	0
Hush your mouth.	I'll be away a lot.	0
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.	Line?	0
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...	Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.	0
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.	This has nothing to do with that.	0
Yes.	Yes, what?	0
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.	Yes mam...	0
I'm so close I can feel it.	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?	0
Yeah.	Don't you think I do?	0
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.	How about Italy?	0
Say something it's too quiet.	Umm, Ummmmm	0
How did you meet Choco?	I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.	0
I've got something...	I sincerely hope so.	0
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.	Over there. In the backseat of the...	0
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?	Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.	0
You'd better get to bed yourself.	I think I'll read a little.	0
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.	0
I think I'll go to bed.	Oh. Well, goodnight.	0
You're such an asshole.	A happy coincidence.	0
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.	After the funeral I just had to leave.	0
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?	So tell me about it.	0
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.	Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...	0
Jack doesn't need money.	I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.	0
Mmm ... what are you doing?	All I need is the one day.	0
I am irate!	And where'd you go?	0
How was your game?	Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.	0
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.	Open the door, will you?	0
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.	I'll go and get my valise.	0
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --	You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.	0
What do you think you're doing?	Yeah!	0
That's easy enough.	Just get your clothes on...	0
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.	What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.	0
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?	Okay.	0
How many victims are up there?	I love you too, Frances.	0
...Which one...?	Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!	0
Did you hear the child out?	I'm sorry.	0
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.	Yeah, sure. Of course.	0
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.	No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.	0
When I say I love you.	Please don't misunderstand me...	0
I didn't.	Then you're not a pro.	0
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.	Ui-vol-i-tub!	0
You make me feel...	Loved?	0
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.	Flip a coin.	0
We had to work. My family was poor.	No that's it.	0
What papers?	The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.	0
0 my god.	So are you.	0
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.	I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...	0
No rain.	Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...	0
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?	Keep stroking it!	0
Why?	Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.	0
Hola..	Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?	0
You flaunt some slut in my face.	Sharon's far from a slut.	0
So you like bookstores, huh?	No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.	0
What am I wanted for?	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...	0
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.	Why?  We're only talking.	0
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.	He's in interrogation?	0
Why did you lie to me?	Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.	0
Zeke.	What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."	0
Brumby.	Is he coming here?	0
"Frenzy".	Yes I know.	0
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!	Were all these people questioned this afternoon?	0
What time is it?	No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?	0
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?	You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?	0
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.	Well, that'll be the first time.	0
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.	-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --	0
Out of the Army?	He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--	0
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.	So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.	0
You don't know what you're fucking with here.	Tell me.	0
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?	I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.	0
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.	It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.	0
So what's her name?	You know. I got a lot, more than one.	0
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.	Left behind?	0
Find anything?	You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?	0
Copy.	No I haven't...	0
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--	Yeah.	0
Yes.  It's faster.	No,  I'm not going through there.	0
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.	Wouldn't they normally be locked?	0
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?	No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.	0
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.	That bastard Pucinski...	0
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.	And they loved Bear.	0
Why do men chase women?	Sure.	0
Whatever...	Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?	0
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.	Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.	0
No...	Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.	0
Guys ready to order?	Okay.	0
Take it. damn it!	Okay.	0
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...	Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.	0
I should have told you sooner --	He'll, what else can I do with it all?	0
That's all?	Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.	0
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.	Hi.	0
Yeah, right...	Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.	0
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.	I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.	0
She's alive!! She is not dead?	I guess he didn't.	0
We can always do that, Duff.	Trust me.	0
But why is he doing it?	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.	0
I know it.	Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?	0
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.	Jean Baptiste!	0
You're an animal.	That's true. What are you?	0
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.	SSHHEEIILLAAA!	0
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.	Let's go.	0
Yes!	I like it.	0
Have you ever kissed anyone?	Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...	0
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...	The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...	0
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.	0
It's been a while.	I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.	0
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.	Here?	0
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.	You have to say that. You're my student.	0
You getting this?	-- Every word.	0
Louis, are you sure?	I'm sure.	0
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.	0
So youíre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thatís a down payment on a Ford Focus!	Would you have believed me?	0
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --	-- This your idea of small talk?	0
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.	Oh, I doubt that's the case.	0
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.	Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?	0
Can't you open the door?!	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.	0
Okay.	Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.	0
Then don't go to Hollywood.	Why?	0
Oh, you do?	Childs.	0
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.	I know because... it's just something I know.	0
Yeah.	What did he say?	0
Well, how did you like the class, David?	Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?	0
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.	0
What was he doing?	Is it true?	0
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.	Oh, well, then you better listen to him.	0
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --	Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.	0
Yes.	Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.	0
What the hell is going on?	A... I gotta go.	0
What? I... I wasn't saying...	Please, there's no... Oh.	0
You're just come in --	Calm down.	0
ok.	You just move in here?	0
Why not?	No, Judy, you don't understand.	0
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?	0
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.	Sally--!	0
He's a secretive man.	No that's it.	0
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.	Yes?	0
Finnegan...	Meet me in front. Five minutes.	0
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?	I love you now, I'll love you always --	0
Looting and pillaging, eh?	Yes.	0
Not when I'm with you, Ted.	I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.	0
You're just scared.	Am I?	0
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.	So you've said.	0
It's ok, take your time.	337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.	0
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.	I wish I could believe that, Doctor.	0
What're you doing here, Roy?	Why are you doing this to yourself?	0
Are you finished?	Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?	0
Then why did you quit?	I wanted to be a good one.	0
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?	Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.	0
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.	Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.	0
And here is one of Frederick's mother.	I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *	0
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?	No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.	0
You were wonderful!	You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.	0
Like you're from N'Yawk.	Give me 30 years, I'll get it.	0
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."	Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.	0
Yeah?	Just a second, I'll be right with you...	0
Oh no. Youíll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.	Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brotherís not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than heíd bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...	0
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.	0
I will be in just a minute.	The picture starts at eight-fifty.	0
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.	You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnít one of them.	0
No, you don't.	Yes, I do. I love them!	0
Just local, of course.	And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"	0
Very.	Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?	0
You're. Acting. Like your father.	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.	0
Well?	I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.	0
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.	What does that mean?	0
Won't mother be proud.	You're really flipped--aren't you.	0
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.	That's because I am the shark.	0
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.	Fine.	0
It wasn't much of a lie.	If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.	0
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...	... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.	0
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?	Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.	0
Get out!	Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.	0
I told him you were my boyfriend.	What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!	0
Tommy...!	I'm all right.	0
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.	I don't know - into the air I suppose.	0
He didn't.	Oh, he did.	0
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.	Let's go, Reggie.	0
What about you?	No that's it.	0
....Hi.....	....Hi.....	0
Where?	We're gonna get married.	0
Why?	Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?	0
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?	Well, wait and see.	0
Oh.  Well, where do we start?	Ask, You're the girl reporter.	0
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!	Hey!	0
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.	It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.	0
You know how to make chocolate milk?	I think I could figure it out.	0
Why you?	I was at hand.	0
Yes..	Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.	0
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.	Not yet!	0
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.	Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.	0
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?	To kill me.	0
I consider it less my failure than his.	Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.	0
Latitude 47 degrees.	I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?	0
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?	We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.	0
In Edmunds' things.	You went through Edmunds' things?	0
At seven-thirty?	The caramel thing is my pick-up line.	0
Hi, Rob and Carrie.	Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.	0
Do you want me to go?	Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.	0
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.	I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.	0
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.	0
Bastard, sneak, quitter.	Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!	0
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.	0
Do you know how to follow a map?	"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.	0
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.	He's right here in the...	0
You like a good saloon?	It's the only place I'm happy.	0
Does you mother still work?	Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.	0
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.	Hey.	0
What's this?	My apartment.	0
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.	Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-	0
Right.	And you'd be my cousin?	0
Ever been tempted?	Michael! Come inside!	0
You too?	Yeah.	0
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .	Yes.	0
How old is she?	You want to read it?	0
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.	I haven't paid you.	0
Of course I do!	Want to go out and have one with me?	0
No.	The dirty snowball at its core.	0
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --	Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.	0
And that's not the same thing?	Don't you know?	0
I beg your pardon?	Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?	0
What brought you down here, Greg?	Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -ó	0
Do I look as funny as you do?	Yes, no.	0
If I'd known you were alive --	I would have done the same thing.	0
Let it go.	How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?	0
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.	I know. I could have picked you up.	0
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.	Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.	0
As far as I know.	I've got to take a piss.	0
From who?	Okay. See you later.	0
Everything's gonna be fine.	Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...	0
I've been thinking.	I'll mention it upstairs.	0
No, Alex. It's, it's --	What?	0
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?	Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.	0
That was incredible. You're brilliant!	You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.	0
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!	Yes. You and I, Jessica.	0
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.	No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...	0
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.	So are you. You've got a vision.	0
Is it that hopeless?	Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thatís where he's headed.	0
Isn't he a salesman?	Now what could he sell at three in the morning?	0
Of course.  When?	I mean home.  India.	0
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.	Can I call you?	0
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.	Hello, Hildy!	0
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?	I don't know.	0
No?	No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.	0
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!	Blue men.	0
It was no accident....	I'm okay. It's okay.	0
Miller, do you read me, Peters --	Nothing.	0
Nothing.	It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...	0
But then you'll forget about me.	That's all, Ned. Thank you.	0
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?	No.	0
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.	Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.	0
Tomorrow?	Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.	0
I keep thinking about him.	Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.	0
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.	I don't want to see the dress.	0
Right around here, in the food court.	You really do hear a lot, don't you?	0
You mean -- break in?	I know my treasure.	0
I knew he wouldn't come.	Because thatís where I live.	0
Which ones?	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.	0
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...	Every damn day.	0
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?	Why didn't you tell me?	0
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?	It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.	0
Who?	Me!	0
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.	It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.	0
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.	My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.	0
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.	Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?	0
Hell...	I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.	0
Havana.	Are you okay?  You want some help?	0
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.	All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.	0
What are you talking about?	In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.	0
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?	Not yet.	0
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!	But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.	0
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.	What?	0
You said ... one shot.	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.	0
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.	What danger?	0
No speech?	Can I come in?	0
He looked old, didn't he?	I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?	0
I know that you used to work with an architect.	And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.	0
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .	No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.	0
I'm fine.	I'll do it myself.	0
Oh, come on.	Ohh!	0
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.	He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.	0
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.	They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.	0
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.	The Mask.	0
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?	If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.	0
You didn't even find that out?	I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.	0
Thanks, Dad.	They're eggs.	0
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?	Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.	0
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.	What changed?	0
Indy! Help me!	Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?	0
There's a spider in the bathroom.	What!	0
What? What is it?	Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.	0
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.	I do.	0
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?	No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.	0
Yeah?	I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.	0
You matter to me.  Completely.	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--	0
Don't stop. Keep moving.	Yes, mustn't stop.	0
Yeah?	Photojournalist.	0
I don't care! We'd be together.	Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...	0
Where are you going?	Tired?	0
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.	Shari...	0
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.	Fucking kike.	0
You mentioned that in your letters	I always thought you'd follow me up.	0
You had to tell him.	I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.	0
She will if you think she should.	And you think it's best if I don't come.	0
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.	Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--	0
Itís sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.	It's just impossible.	0
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.	Like what?	0
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --	0
Call me Nancy.	Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?	0
You've been around.	I guess I've got wander in my blood.	0
That!	Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...	0
Yes, you are. And you must wake.	All right.	0
To the Riviera.	What'd you have?	0
Why can't you do it?	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts	0
Screaming	Besides that.	0
Please.	Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.	0
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!	Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --	0
What do you want me to do?	Sit.	0
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.	I thought they were clever.	0
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.	How prominent?	0
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.	Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.	0
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?	I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.	0
Got any requests?	That country shit all sounds the same to me.	0
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?	Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.	0
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	I'm Father Karras.	0
And what are you? A cop?	Now?	0
What?	Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?	0
Any time.	Tonight?	0
It's cold.	It's 'pose to be cold.	0
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.	You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.	0
Now, what do you want?	I said I just wanted to talk to you...	0
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....	<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.	0
What's going on?	Rain.	0
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.	Maybe we can handle it together.	0
You like to open me, don't you?	Yes.	0
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.	Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.	0
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.	And I you.	0
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.	No, this is me in a nutshell.	0
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.	Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!	0
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.	Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--	0
Nick, the ice is --	Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!	0
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?	Something good?	0
Really?	Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.	0
You don't believe it was a car accident.	What do you think.	0
Well, I don't.	Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."	0
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.	What do you want to know?	0
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...	Robin, listen to me.	0
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.	What?	0
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...	That's what I want.	0
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.	Important?	0
Nobody told me.	you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.	0
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?	0
In that order?	Well no...inverse order.	0
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.	I know you will.	0
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?	0
Did you like my friend Frankie?	No.	0
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.	Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...	0
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.	How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?	0
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!	And as barren of love as stone.	0
She's only perfect.	Oh, no. She brought me my meals.	0
A Federal offense.	What letter?	0
I won't have you fighting over me.	I'm sorry.	0
It looks wonderful.	I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"	0
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.	I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...	0
Ichabod...	Thank you, Susie.	0
Maybe I've just got the creeps.	How could you?! This is just like home!	0
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.	We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.	0
What about now?	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?	0
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.	I don't care. You pick.	0
Bullshit.	I swear to God.	0
He's okay isn't he?	There were just too many of 'em.	0
You forgot this.	Thanks.	0
I should go get some of her things.	No, let me go.	0
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.	Another time.	0
So?	Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.	0
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?	I don't know.	0
You... fed on me?	Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.	0
Just give it to me!!	Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.	0
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.	I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?	0
I would think so.	Yeah, I would think so, too.	0
Then, where are you going?	Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.	0
That's a dumb thing to say.	You're right.	0
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.	0
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.	Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.	0
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.	It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.	0
So few come back...	Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...	0
I want to have a baby.	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.	0
Vaughan, don't get pushy.	I'm sorry.	0
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.	Try me.	0
Are you close?	She's my mother.	0
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.	I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.	0
You're leaving right now?	No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...	0
Well, that's a long time.	It's not that long.	0
For tonight.	Oh!	0
Electra.	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.	0
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.	I don't understand.	0
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--	And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?	0
Well, you're catching on.	Who, for instance?	0
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.	He video taped you.	0
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.	So why pick me?	0
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?	Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?	0
We need beer....	David! David! I can't believe this!	0
What are you doing?	I'm sorry?	0
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --	You must have been a baby.	0
Is that what you think--	--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.	0
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.	You, me and White, huh?	0
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.	Yes, dear.	0
May I ask why?	I can imagine.	0
Why do you love peanut butter so much?	Extremely clever.	0
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.	Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.	0
I'm about to blow the wall.	No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.	0
What's this, Diz?	Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.	0
I'm sorry.	I'm telling you, I can't.	0
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.	0
You just haven't met the right person.	I have a question to ask you. A personal question.	0
Huh?	All right then! Yes!	0
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.	What are you doing?	0
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...	0
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.	0
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.	You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?	0
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.	Yes--I think maybe you'd better.	0
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.	Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.	0
You fell in love with her first.	No.	0
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.	Sure...	0
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.	Really?	0
What?	Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?	0
I couldn't have... much longer.	I was.	0
How is her family going to feel about it?	But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?	0
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.	Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.	0
Something happened with Marty and Ray--	Was she? Did you notice?	0
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.	Probably see you at the book store.	0
No.	Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?	0
What!?	Let me guess. Amy presumed Iíd forget the rings.  I think Iím her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.	0
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.	I don't want anyone to die.	0
I'm sorry...I....	There's nothing to be sorry about.	0
You gave your word?	Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.	0
Who is it?	It's me.	0
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.	I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --	0
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?	Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...	0
Clearly.	Let's go down to the basement.	0
What the hell do I do now?	I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.	0
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.	Lothos.	0
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.	Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.	0
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.	With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.	0
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?	Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.	0
Yes.	Why?	0
...they say you're alright.	I'm fine.	0
Oh!	Come on, what was it?	0
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.	Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.	0
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.	I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.	0
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.	Laurie --	0
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.	Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.	0
Wow! It's brilliant!	I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.	0
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.	Gordon Liddy, you mean?	0
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?	Or we could do that yeah.	0
Some kind of animal?	The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.	0
It's quite out of the question.	The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.	0
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?	0
No. It's a mess.	Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.	0
I don't know.	Where am I?	0
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.	Certainly not at my happy home.	0
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.	Good.  See ya soon.	0
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.	That was stressful. I found that stressful.	0
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?	0
Yes.	I'm sorry.	0
Thanks, Melvin.	Welcome.	0
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.	Well, what else does?	0
Are you or aren't you?	I'm sorry that I became so upset.	0
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?	The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.	0
Just down the hall.	No, no, no. Now that's too much!	0
What, for example?	I'll be glad to avoid the crush.	0
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.	The "come back" kind.	0
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.	I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.	0
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.	A gay lot -ó Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...	0
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?	You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...	0
I heard you playing.	Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...	0
Did she break your heart?	How?	0
Much happier.	All right.	0
That's not playing by the rules.	That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.	0
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?	Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.	0
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.	I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?	0
You're impossible...	No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.	0
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.	It's over.	0
You don't want to talk about it.	No.	0
And what happened to Carl?	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.	0
He's my teacher!	Shhhh.	0
Yes! Hi.	Am I interrupting anything?	0
Yes.	What was your major?	0
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.	...Not the bat?	0
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.	* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *	0
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?	So we should "wait and see." For how long?	0
Everything okay?	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?	0
He go back to the hotel?	Uh..he might of.	0
Jesus, she's my best friend.	Yeah.	0
Tell me about the kids.	You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...	0
There's something wrong with this picture.	What picture?	0
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.	I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.	0
What crisis?	Are you lyin' to me?	0
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.	Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.	0
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.	I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.	0
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?	Mission accomplished.	0
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?	By the bunks.	0
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--	0
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?	My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.	0
What are you doing here?!	Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.	0
How was your lunch with Charlie?	Oh -- great.	0
The £1,000 is on account.	My rates...	0
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.	Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...	0
Don't tell me --	-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --	0
When you do, let me in on it.	Make it so.	0
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.	But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...	0
No!  No!  You won't come back either.	What? Oh, yes, please.	0
Yeah, and he's strangling me...	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.	0
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.	Baker's unabridged.	0
Why?!	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.	0
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.	It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.	0
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.	That's right.  I do, don't I?	0
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?	If I was your boyfriend, I might be.	0
What happened to him?	I don't know. He moved away.	0
Uh, yes.	Meet me in front. Five minutes.	0
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?	0
What's Cao Ben?	You think I didn't get that?	0
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.	-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --	0
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...	Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.	0
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--	WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??	0
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.	I hope it wasn't cheap.	0
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...	Big case?	0
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?	No	0
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.	Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.	0
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.	0
I believe it.	Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.	0
There's plenty of fruit.	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.	0
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...	Uh-huh?	0
I don't know. They didn't answer.	What'd you talk about?	0
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....	I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--	0
On the dark nights ó on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.	Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.	0
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?	Trust me.	0
Go on.	Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.	0
I want some more.	It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.	0
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.	Rheya --	0
We'll take the Royal Suite!	But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.	0
Danny, come here!	There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.	0
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.	... Mentor...?	0
I had to arrange about the trip.	You're sweet.	0
We had a good laugh, didn't we?	Yeah. I guess we did.	0
No bad dreams.	You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....	0
That's enough of that kind of talk!	I just said--	0
... Mike.	It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.	0
What will your father say?	Linda... Hey, Linda...	0
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...	Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?	0
Where are you?	A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.	0
I can't hear this now --	I think it looks good.	0
We did...?	Where have you been...	0
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?	You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?	0
Did you get a room?	No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --	0
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.	Tell 'em.	0
Did it go well, darling?	Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.	0
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.	Lily.	0
At least they made an offer.	Oh - I'll get it!	0
If they are, they're screening their calls.	Range 3000 meters and closing.	0
And now....	They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....	0
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.	Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.	0
It's important that I learn this.	Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.	0
She what?!	I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.	0
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.	No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.	0
No. The question now is how long itís going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.	Excuse me?	0
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.	<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?	0
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.	0
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?	0
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.	That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.	0
I know that...	...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.	0
Really? Well, let it rip.	Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --	0
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.	Soran?	0
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.	I don't expect you to understand.	0
I want to do it.	She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?	0
Of course.	Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.	0
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?	I hate this fucking place.	0
Apipoulai!	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...	0
Epps.	Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.	0
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?	0
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....	Where is she?	0
What happened?	What difference does it make...?	0
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?	Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?	0
Why? What the big deal?	Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'	0
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.	I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.	0
Regardless, he still is your father.	Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.	0
So -- how are things?	Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.	0
Peter, you're bleeding.	Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?	0
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.	0
He doesn't trust you.	You're sure you don't want to try?	0
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.	I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.	0
We made it.  Neil, we made it!	This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?	0
Did I miss something?	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.	0
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.	I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.	0
Leave then, some friend you are.	You can come to my house for dinner?	0
Just one arm!	Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?	0
I don't care. They're out.	Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.	0
I bet you say that to all the girls...	With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...	0
Yes...	I'm thinking about it.	0
Yes.	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--	0
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?	No.	0
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.	Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -	0
...but first, you have to tell me something...	Why's that?	0
So what'd they say?	The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...	0
You love me then?	Of course I do.	0
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.	That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...	0
What are you taking?	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?	0
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.	Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?	0
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --	Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!	0
Who did it?	Hi, honey.	0
Oh, no.  Now what?	Must be a circuit breaker.	0
Don't I get a kiss?	I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...	0
Sam took them to a movie.	I'll be in the bedroom.	0
I didn't like Preysing right off.	-- I'm probably not gonna go though.	0
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?	I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.	0
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?	Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?	0
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.	So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.	0
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...	But if someone miniaturized the process...	0
How do you know?	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.	0
Yeah.	Me too.	0
Don't worry. It's a test.	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.	0
You're not sleepy?	Justin?	0
Yeah.	You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.	0
Fine. How are you?	Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.	0
I'd like that.	It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.	0
What's the sec...	Mirrors.	0
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?	Just sit back and enjoy the show.	0
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...	Why don't you just move out to Portchester?	0
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.	0
With what?	With the money.	0
You're --	Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.	0
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.	<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.	0
No, Jesus, no.	-- OK --	0
Do what?	Sneak up behind me like that.	0
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.	Of course, my dear.	0
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.	I thought he was with you.	0
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?	Have what?	0
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!	You said -	0
What happened to your neck?	Yes.	0
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.	--not fair?	0
At what?	I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.	0
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.	She pay you much?	0
He's not what I expected, Sir.	Where?	0
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.	Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.	0
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.	This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.	0
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.	Uh, it's a deep south expression.	0
So what you think of me?	Someone did.	0
No.  There's no way!	Hear me out...	0
Yes.	We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!	0
You sure about this?	Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?	0
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?	I don't know.	0
You don't know me.	Call the police.	0
That's a simple subject.	Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.	0
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.	I absolutely agree with Marge.	0
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.	Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...	0
You had a son.	OK, OK.	0
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".	Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.	0
Will you bring me a hanger?	What?	0
What's that?	One of the accountants.	0
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.	You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?	0
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?	That's a good question.	0
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.	I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.	0
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?	Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.	0
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!	All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.	0
It used to make me laugh, but.	I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.	0
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.	She's beautiful, you know?	0
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.	How much oh-two do we have?	0
It's just that I hate empty rooms.	Sure.	0
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.	Jezuz Christ!	0
<u>Jack</u>!	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--	0
Right now.	Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.	0
Very smart indeed.	I'm sorry, I can't.	0
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.	Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?	0
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?	Right.  That's true.	0
Hello, my little boy.	Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.	0
Oh, yeah.	What a body, what a voice.	0
I want to go home.	You can't.	0
Listen, I'm sorry I --	Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?	0
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.	No.  I mean it, thank you.	0
That's not an answer, is it?	It was the only thing I've ever asked him!	0
What happened to his eyes?	We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...	0
Why?	I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.	0
He was a bit proud as I recall.	He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.	0
No!	But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.	0
Sue Ann Hanson.	Do you know the <u>seller</u>?	0
Howard, your one o'clock.	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.	0
My mother died in this canyon.	No thanks.	0
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?	Yes, we will.	0
Yes.	Why?	0
Well maybe for you.	I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.	0
I need a shower.	Why do you wanna know so bad?	0
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.	0
But it's not the same.	That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.	0
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...	Oh.	0
Who have you been talking to?	I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....	0
How do you know?	It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?	0
...what're you saying?	When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.	0
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.	It's over, Evelyn. It's all over	0
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.	Letitia.	0
Very--your mother?	Don't be a c-a-t.	0
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.	The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....	0
Yes.	I can't write it!	0
Now what?	It's locked?	0
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?	Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?	0
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?	Erin --	0
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.	A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.	0
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --	Why?	0
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.	0
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?	I don't want to talk about it -	0
My vacation is over in a week.	What about?	0
With a wildly beating heart.	Life can be beautiful!	0
Where you goin'!?	Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.	0
What is it??	And you feel the same way with John?	0
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?	I'd be honored.	0
I don't like you.	Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.	0
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...	Are you that sure of tomorrow?	0
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.	0
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.	Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.	0
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?	Yeah.	0
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?	Well, why not?	0
Ted, do you love him?	Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--	0
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?	Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.	0
What?	It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.	0
You're next, Norman.	Flowers!  What flowers?	0
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.	Listen to me, it's over.	0
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?	We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.	0
Pardon?	What'd you say?	0
It's...him.	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.	0
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?	It is no trickery.	0
It's a shit novel anyway.	Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.	0
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...	You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.	0
That's not my handwriting.	Tell them I'm not.	0
Hi.	You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.	0
Not embarrassed.	Ashamed.	0
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.	Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.	0
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.	What's that?	0
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.	And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?	0
...You got no cause to hurt me.	Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?	0
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.	Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?	0
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.	It's December 25th, 1993 today.	0
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.	No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?	0
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?	What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.	0
No, I'm not playing this game.	No, this is serious. Say it backwards.	0
Are you awake?	I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.	0
That is not what I'm --	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.	0
He's liable to shoot you.	Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.	0
I'm afraid of who I am.	I was.	0
Are you worried about tomorrow night?	Not really.	0
Take it slowly.	So damn stupid.	0
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.	I know.  Is *that* nothing.	0
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.	Sooner it you like.	0
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.	Be specific.	0
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.	I don't know.	0
I see.  Do you like the play?	Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.	0
Why are you doing all this for me?	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.	0
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.	It's okay.	0
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.	Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.	0
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.	Yeah.	0
Where are Thomas and Fedens?	I sent them home. Go and call them.	0
Really?	Can you help <u>me</u>?	0
Daddy, I --	And where're you going?	0
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.	What truth?	0
George, now cut this out.	You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?	0
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...	Cured, yes.	0
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --	I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.	0
Bad show last night?	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...	0
Excuse me?	There is only one bed.	0
Great, bye.	Bye.	0
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.	Me?	0
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?	As of this moment you're six years old...	0
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!	He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?	0
You don't talk very much.	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.	0
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.	Good. So did I.	0
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?	Sure.	0
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.	0
Either one will be fine.	Okay.	0
The kitchen.	Very nice.	0
Can we change the subject?	Great.	0
Surprise.	Couple of months anyway.	0
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --	Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --	0
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?	A kiss.	0
Did you say something?	I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.	0
Where did you get that sweater?	You mean you have finished the whole investigation?	0
Okay...	Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?	0
So, now what?	This is the first book that I got you.	0
Oh my god! On TV!	Why? How...	0
I won't, I swear.	Look, I think we should work things out.	0
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.	I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.	0
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.	G'bye, Ms. Sindell.	0
Why?	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.	0
No.	See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!	0
Niece?	I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.	0
Deceive us?	I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.	0
What are you getting at, Professor?	With a jacked-up attitude.	0
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.	I'm almost done.	0
Why should I come hollering to you at all?	You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?	0
It's not fair to you.  This whole --	Tell me -- let me help --	0
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.	Television?	0
Cause I don't even know you.	In the house?	0
What are these?	They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.	0
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.	Put your shoulders back.	0
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.	I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.	0
Gay.	Being here, with me.	0
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.	Uh-huh.	0
Are you okay?	Of course.	0
Course I did.	-- in the act.	0
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.	0
What is it?	Don't know--but it's better'n this.	0
Bill!	Huh?	0
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?	Sorry.	0
He's in Palermo.	Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.	0
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.	People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.	0
A man helped me open it...	And switched keys.	0
Can I use the bathroom?	I'm sorry...	0
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.	A simple yes or no would have done.	0
For exits off Main Street.	Of course I can. I have a note from mother.	0
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?	Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.	0
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.	I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.	0
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.	Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?	0
Yes, sir--	Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?	0
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.	Please.	0
Why do you hunt them?	You don't think he's mixed up in -	0
I wasn't waiting for a bus.	And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.	0
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.	Me neither...	0
What?	Switch! You drive!	0
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?	0
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.	I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.	0
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.	If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?	0
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.	Yes what?	0
What are those things?	I don't know...	0
That is correct.	Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?	0
Curse?	Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.	0
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?	Uh-huh.	0
Well?	Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.	0
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.	I told you, I'm not going back.	0
And ...your friend?	Yeah.	0
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...	Yeah?!	0
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.	It's her, ain't it?	0
It's not -- what's a 422?	It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --	0
And I with you. But you must wake.	Go away.	0
Get back?  From where?	Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.	0
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.	The last I looked, we were just talking things over.	0
God, David. Just give it to me!	Get lost!	0
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?	Terrific.	0
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.	What do you mean?	0
I know that. But you can now.	Baby, you didn't have to come.	0
George...	No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.	0
I was beautiful then.	Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.	0
Oh, no, I have a car.	You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?	0
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.	I appreciate the offer but you really don't --	0
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.	I know, Mother.	0
Wrong number.	Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.	0
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.	You going to sleep here, all by yourself?	0
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.	No. Come on.	0
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.	With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.	0
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.	Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?	0
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.	Don't be a c-a-t.	0
I think, therefore I am.	Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.	0
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...	Stop talking...	0
He used that?	Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!	0
I was just getting ready to take a bath.	No way.	0
No you don't.	If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?	0
I'm intrigued.	You're intrigued?	0
Don't let me fall!	Do it, goddammit!	0
Yes. He never forgave him for it.	It's all I think about anymore.	0
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.	Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.	0
You think?	Sorry.  You okay?	0
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.	What's your brand?	0
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?	It's not a village. There's nothing there.	0
No!  It will cave in!	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .	0
Open it.	You want me to kick it open?	0
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...	That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.	0
Want to be a high climber now, do you?	I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.	0
Uh-huh.	Yeah - Josephine.	0
See for yourself.	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...	0
That doesn't sound dark.	Yeah, well they may this one.	0
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.	Just watch it when he does.	0
I can't.	Come on.	0
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.	I don't know.	0
Ohh!	The does it. It's going to be this weekend.	0
Oh --	Jesus.	0
Shouldn't we pull over?	No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.	0
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.	Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.	0
I thought I'd stay the night.	What for?	0
What?	It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...	0
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.	No.  You know that I'm not.	0
No, tell me.	That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?	0
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?	Oh. Yeah.	0
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.	Then we'll do something else.	0
Fine piece of engineering.	Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.	0
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.	I'll make the soap myself.	0
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.	I keep the heat on.	0
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!	Do I get to hit you after you tell me?	0
We might have; I don't remember. How many?	Including you?	0
It's true, isn't it?	What's her story?	0
That's really strange. What does it mean?	Yes, Eve?	0
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?	It's fine, thank you.	0
That wonít be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.	We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?	0
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.	Every word, Starling? Every gesture?	0
Yes.	So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.	0
uh...uh...What is it?	I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".	0
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.	Yes. I was.	0
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --	I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --	0
They're practically on us . . .	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts	0
And scary.	And scary.	0
All summer?	He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.	0
What?	To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.	0
What are they?	To calm your anxiety.	0
But the power...	You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.	0
Trix...	Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!	0
Maestro.	Good morning.	0
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...	A cowboy.	0
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?	I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.	0
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.	Jesus.	0
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?	I... do not want this...	0
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --	Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.	0
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?	I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.	0
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?	...Guess.	0
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?	They're yellow.	0
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.	That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.	0
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?	Sure.	0
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.	M'hm.	0
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...	Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --	0
Watchers?	Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...	0
Maybe I'll tell you later.	All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.	0
You're leaving, aren't you?	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.	0
It is an emergency, isn't it?	Yeah.	0
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?	So where are we going, Princess?	0
What's wrong?	Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.	0
Designer clothes.	She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.	0
You don't even know me.	Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?	0
What'd he say?	"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"	0
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?	Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?	0
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.	Do you think they bought it?	0
I take it you've heard.	They're dead.	0
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.	You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?	0
With what?	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.	0
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?	They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--	0
No!  It will cave in!	Itís the only way out...	0
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.	Sam?	0
Oh tsht. Yes.	I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...	0
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?	You sure?	0
I didn't do that.	Who did?  Mrs. Feur?	0
Hmm.  Pretty good.	Now what did you lose?	0
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.	Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?	0
Actually, I don't make friends easily.	You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.	0
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.	Have you ever been to that station?	0
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!	What?	0
So what?	If they are not here, he must have sent them away.	0
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...	That's right. And douse some in it.	0
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.	Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.	0
Found?  Where?	Somewhere.	0
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?	Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...	0
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.	Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.	0
Excuse me?	When youíre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....	0
Alright, I'm here. Now what?	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.	0
You said you couldn't kill anybody.	Because you didn't love him --	0
I'm in till the end.	Hmmm - good coffee.	0
That never stopped you before.	Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...	0
That's not funny.	That was great!	0
Not now.	Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.	0
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.	They're new to us...	0
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?	Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?	0
Now, why in the world would he do that?	I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.	0
Well, stop the world.	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.	0
But...who...	Do I get to hit you after you tell me?	0
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...	Stop it!	0
Then what the fuck did you do it for?	He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.	0
Something like that.	It's too loud for me.	0
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.	People now have dignity when frying eggs?	0
Do I sit or stand?	Who was it answered the phone?	0
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.	Me? I could never go to a place like that.	0
How about inviting me over to dinner?	You know what I mean.	0
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.	What's in Florida?	0
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.	0
What was he doing?	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --	0
What'd you put him in there for?	Just to keep him out of the sun.	0
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...	You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.	0
No kiddin'?	I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.	0
What about the world?	I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.	0
What do you think you're doing?	You have a pimp?	0
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.	Which you have in mind.	0
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.	It does.	0
You said you didn't trust it.	...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?	0
Knox, you are so infuriating!	Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.	0
I don't know, but we can't stay here.	Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.	0
Yes!	Were you present when all these things took place?	0
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.	Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...	0
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...	That was just a mix up.	0
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.	Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...	0
Where are you, Peter?	<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...	0
You know how to waltz??	I was going to fake it.	0
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.	Well, here you are.	0
Enough?	Never enough.	0
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?	This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?	0
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.	I am. Well, maybe not completely--	0
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --	Cynthia, I don't know.	0
Damn right.	Well, it is. It is that, too.	0
What did you say?	That's right.	0
Jimmy, you've got --	I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.	0
Where to?	I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.	0
I never asked you to choose.	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.	0
Yeah.	Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.	0
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.	Maybe it's time for a vacation.	0
Will you take me home now?	How's your wife?	0
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?	0
No.	And into a black dress.	0
But you've tested it?	Are you asking me if I have something to prove?	0
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.	The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.	0
Won't mother be proud.	Come on, let's check the bite radius.	0
Hello...?	Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.	0
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.	What the bloody hell plan is this?	0
I can handle that.	Well, get to it.	0
Exactly.  And he got good.	No kidding.	0
Where will you find such a girl?	Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.	0
Couple months before I was born--	Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--	0
How'm I doing so far?	So far you're great. You got a cigarette?	0
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.	I bet he don't. Karl likes me.	0
We have to tell her she's in danger!	I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.	0
Yes.	No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?	0
Are you okay.	But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.	0
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.	But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!	0
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!	Yeah.	0
I am looking where I should to become a bride!	There's no choice.	0
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?	If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...	0
Why not?	Put Kelly on too.	0
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.	Waiting's hard. You never learn how.	0
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.	Is he a Nazi?	0
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.	You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.	0
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.	Shut up.	0
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.	Let's hope it holds.	0
No.	All right.	0
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.	The locks.	0
There's somebody else on this boat.	You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.	0
Oh now, don't be silly.	I shant!	0
They can look forward to that.	Sure.	0
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!	That's a great idea.	0
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.	Your Dad play?	0
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.	I'm serious.	0
I am not a frightened girl.	That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.	0
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?	Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.	0
Good. Where are we?	Some committee's got it.	0
I don't know, he didn't say anything.	Youíre judging me?! Oh, thatís a good one. Youíre lying to me, youíre lying to your family, and youíre lying to yourself. But youíre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?	0
What are you going to talk to me about?	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.	0
Yes?	I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.	0
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?	Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.	0
Which room is it?	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.	0
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...	Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?	0
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	No thanks, Lee.	0
Do you like me?	Not for Quincy McCall.	0
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...	Well.	0
No.	I'm a salesman.	0
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.	It's okay. It's okay.	0
Yes?	Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.	0
Yes.	Don't you think we should turn off the heat?	0
How can you do that if she's already off the line?	I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.	0
What...happened?	Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually.	0
No, we don't have to say it.	Your brother's here?	0
Mr. Kessler?	Yes?	0
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.	You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.	0
He could live with us.	Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?	0
Don't be too hard on him.	Hell, I'm just like him.	0
And it's a shorter commute.	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?	0
Likewise.	It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.	0
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.	0
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.	Fun.	0
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.	Yeah?	0
He's right.	Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?	0
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.	I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.	0
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!	She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.	0
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things óófrightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -ó waiting óó I feel as if I'd never known her.	At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life óó that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.	0
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!	She could be dead now.	0
They care about you. They're just a different generation.	Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.	0
What about your twelve brothers?	Can I join in?	0
Set.	Why are ya goin' so early?	0
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.	They won't let you in without one.	0
So what's the scam, Eddie?	I said don't go between them!	0
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?	Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.	0
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.	Penny--?!  Are you all right?	0
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?	You can turn that finger around.	0
Not properly watered.	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.	0
Hush.	How goes it, darlin'?	0
Yes, you did.	No, I didn't.	0
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.	What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!	0
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...	Subtlety?	0
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.	I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	0
I won't lie.	I don't want you to lie.	0
There.	You don't have to--	0
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.	You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!	0
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.	Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.	0
There's no hurry! The race is over!	Not for me.	0
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.	Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.	0
Do you know your parents' blood types?	Do you ever see him?	0
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.	Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.	0
Call me later.	Okay.	0
Yes.	I'm pretty nervous. Are you?	0
...I'm sorry.	Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.	0
Will? Are you awake?	No.	0
It's okay.	Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.	0
You always get what you want?	There's nothing. I'm coming down.	0
Uh, thanks.	The way I see it. Weíll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.	0
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?	Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.	0
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...	He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.	0
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.	You have any children?	0
Home.	The other side....	0
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.	Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--	0
What!?!	It's pretty exciting.	0
Go ahead.	Sandy?	0
Paillarde of veal.	I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...	0
What was that?	Clockworks.	0
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.	They treating you right over at the Bodwins?	0
...Mr. Lundegaard?	...Brainerd?	0
I am.	Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.	0
You did this before, right?	Many times.	0
Someone stole Sid's file?	I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.	0
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?	You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?	0
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing	It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.	0
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?	Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.	0
I...	A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...	0
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--	You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.	0
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--	What shade of powder do you use?	0
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.	Who?	0
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.	Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.	0
I imagine shit needs to be done.	We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.	0
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.	...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.	0
How many?	With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.	0
We should talk alone.	Tomorrow?	0
And "Frank?"	Lint?	0
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --	I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...	0
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.	I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.	0
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.	I don't remember you saying no.	0
He's had some sort of...episode.	What?  What kind of episode?	0
Yeah.	I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.	0
There's hot cider in the kitchen.	Thanks.	0
Hing, hang, hung.	How'd you manage that, then.	0
We've made a lot of pictures together.	And you were drilling these holes...?	0
I couldn't tell you.	Then shoot him already.	0
You okay?	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?	0
Money -- Ever heard of it?	Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?	0
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...	Did Lester know about him?	0
When was this, like '96?	You have no feelings toward ...	0
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!	Yes,... I see.	0
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.	Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.	0
You are upset.	I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.	0
It's my first cigarette in over a year.	I'm never unfair.	0
Hi.	Eve, I'm sorry.	0
Something like that.	That was terrific.	0
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.	You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?	0
You... you couldn't have heard me.	They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.	0
What the hell's going on?	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?	0
There's a lot of people here.	But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.	0
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.	Whatiya mean?	0
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.	I didnít mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.	0
No!	What was it inside that told you to jump?	0
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.	What're you going to do, Charlie?	0
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.	Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?	0
You want to go talk?	You ready?	0
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.	Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.	0
Could be the weight of the snow.	Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.	0
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?	Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....	0
I likes yellow.	Just wanted to put him on edge...	0
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.	Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.	0
I know.  I go with you.	I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.	0
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.	0
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.	That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...	0
I thought you stopped going.	Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.	0
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.	Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?	0
He'll come down. Leave him alone.	Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?	0
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.	Nobody's asking you to.	0
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.	They just finished supper.	0
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.	I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.	0
Why?	No, nothing at all.	0
Llewelyn!	What? Quit hollerin'.	0
Why not?	I... I don't get along with people like that.	0
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.	Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.	0
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.	I'm on at nine.	0
Fuck Kurt.	I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...	0
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!	0
Yeah.	How many?	0
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.	Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?	0
You know how I feel?	My mind's not on guessing games.	0
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?	Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -	0
...Just a minute...	One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --	0
Yeah... I will.	How is Eve? Okay?	0
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.	We spent a night there one night...	0
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -	Carolyn!	0
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.	Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.	0
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.	California, huh?	0
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.	Meaning...?	0
Well - ?	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.	0
Uh-huh?	Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.	0
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.	I had a teacher like that once.	0
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --	I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.	0
Monica and Ryan.	It's impossible!	0
Quincy, please...	For what?  He left.  Not me.	0
How you doing, Ed?	A week ago, I bought a rifle.	0
You shot her?	I should probably write that down.	0
But you've never figured out a way to win.	No.	0
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?	Only you.	0
You didn't answer my question.	I think -- she's crazy.	0
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?	You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?	0
Don't ever let go.	I won't.	0
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.	Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...	0
Tell me what happened?	I'm sorry, I can't.	0
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!	The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.	0
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?	Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?	0
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --	By whom? The Marquis?	0
Michael, I love you.	...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.	0
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.	But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.	0
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.	Not for Quincy McCall.	0
It'll never happen, fuckface.	Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.	0
Hey!	Come on.  We don't have much time.	0
You a handyman, Fergie?	I take pride in my work.	0
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.	Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep	0
Yes.	Three days? I must be.	0
How did you?...	Yeah--	0
Where is he?	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...	0
We're both in it, Harry.	Holly.	0
I'm afraid you've got to.	This is New York City, itís like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arenít a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...	0
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.	We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.	0
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?	Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.	0
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.	0
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.	I don't believe this.	0
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.	She didn't give you my address?	0
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	What -- the bug?	0
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.	Wait a minute.	0
Go Carole.  So, guess what?	All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!	0
Really?	Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.	0
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.	Mary . . .	0
I can't do that.	Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.	0
You think Jade Fox will show up?	She said something about that, Mrs. Reed ó but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.	0
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?	I thought you didn't.	0
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?	Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.	0
So what?	We did our best, Comrade.	0
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.	Thank you.	0
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.	That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.	0
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.	And you were drilling these holes...?	0
Was there any trouble?	He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.	0
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.	He takes good care of that.	0
A thousand times good night! Exit, above	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.	0
What about your glasses?	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.	0
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.	Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?	0
What night?	Did you ever kill a man?	0
Two of us might be more effective than one.	The cameras have arrived, Madame.	0
Then who's buying it?	There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you...	0
I know.	You know? How do you know?	0
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.	No, I know.	0
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?	I have regrets.	0
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.	I like you.	0
I'm sorry?	I don't write.	0
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.	He came to my mind recently, that's all.	0
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?	Good question. Both.  Aleph...	0
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--	Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.	0
Not funny, Sam!	This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!	0
What?  How could he have?  When?	Listen...	0
I have someone I want you to meet.	I'll be right there.	0
And no elbows on the table!	Eating is eating... and...	0
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...	He video taped you.	0
How do you know about Eugene?	Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.	0
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.	But who were they?	0
I gotta go get a haircut.	Well, that's why you got it.	0
With Stargher I saw things...	What did you see?	0
That isn't true.	Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--	0
Uh-huh. Adam?	You used to say that was our strength.	0
Why not?	I've told you.	0
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.	Hmmm.	0
And we won't stretch up our arms...	No! No!	0
Yes.	Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?	0
Who?	Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.	0
That's a terrible thing to say.	Dorsia is...fine.	0
Well.	Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?	0
Do you know what youíre doing?	Like riding a bike.	0
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.	You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.	0
Aw... that's so sweet.	You lived in Japan, when?	0
How's Julie?	Will you hang on just a second.	0
Who?	You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?	0
Where we going?	Why, I needed aó	0
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.	Not really.	0
What do you want to do?	Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.	0
I don't know.  I can't be alone.	I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.	0
Hi...	Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...	0
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.	Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?	0
One shouldn't live alone.	There are days.	0
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.	And who's Claude?	0
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.	With all of it?	0
No argument.	This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.	0
You?	Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to meó he says it's up to me.	0
...yes, I've got that bit...	"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"	0
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.	No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?	0
Then maybe you're ready.	Missed me bad, huh?	0
Doctor...	Yes, Cora.	0
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --	Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?	0
You'll get Ich killed.	Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?	0
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.	This is where I proposed.	0
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.	Is he really that big a sap?	0
Did you call about the Feurs?	Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.	0
Is this really happening?	What do you want to do?	0
I'm sorry...	Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.	0
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.	I know that.	0
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.	Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.	0
That I do.  Always will.	Do you expect me to believe that?	0
Take the next exit.	What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?	0
We're about an hour away.	I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.	0
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.	As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...	0
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.	Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.	0
Which is what?	At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.	0
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	What... you mean "got into bed with" them?	0
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.	Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.	0
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?	Why?	0
Walter!	Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?	0
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?	0
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.	What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.	0
No!	Yes, what?	0
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.	Right.  Why?	0
What kinda trash talk is that?	What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.	0
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.	You don't?	0
Llewelyn?	Storms! Floods!	0
Why?	You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.	0
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.	It does?	0
I don't need the money.	-- Yeah... your car down here?	0
He's waiting for you to mention mention.	You want some advice, Miss Bracken?	0
I can call back...	No, no. Hold on.	0
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"	I'll have someone show you to your room.	0
What are you doin' here?	Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?	0
The long end. Big con.	Nobody does that single-o.	0
Jump in the water!!	But I have my clothes on!	0
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.	Sure.	0
Okay.	Then leave.	0
Hello.	Hi.	0
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.	Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.	0
You what?	Don't push me away.	0
How?	Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.	0
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.	She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.	0
What? What?	You mustn't talk Russian to me.	0
Not even a little bit?	I already told you I'm not.	0
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.	I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?	0
Okay.	Any more soda left?	0
You mean they weren't up here?	They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.	0
That's quite a change of subject.	What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...	0
Well... what happened?	I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...	0
Ronny!	I love the fragrance of chilidogs.	0
But what about the past? Our past?	We never really shared one.	0
What were you doing there?	You don't have to do it for a living.	0
You're kidding.	Bunch of savages in this town.	0
Good night, honey.	Honey - she called me honey.	0
Guess what"s under these coconuts.	What?	0
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.	Habit, mostly, just like this.	0
Is this you?	No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?	0
I met you at my fatherís funeral.	Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...	0
Twelve months in oak.	On a Sauvignon Blanc?	0
-- really incredible --	You being audited?	0
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --	They are or they aren't.  Which is it?	0
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.	Never?	0
Really?	Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!	0
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.	0
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?	Hell, peanut...	0
Are you crazy? What are you doing?	I'm trying to help you.	0
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--	I won't be here Sunday.	0
I've been better.	Well I've got a little surprise for you.	0
We're going to have to explain away the...	Why did you come in here?	0
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.	You ain't heard from him?	0
The Grail Diary.	In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...	0
Why the change? What about your work?	I'll say.	0
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--	Yeah.	0
Okay, what would you have done.	Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.	0
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.	It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.	0
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!	Don't quibble. You know what I mean.	0
What?	Shut up. Have you got your passport?	0
Yes.	Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?	0
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.	Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.	0
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.	I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?	0
So, you just get here?	Yeah, from Boston.	0
I said I think it is.	Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?	0
Did you call about the Feurs?	Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.	0
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --	Don't try to tell me what to do.	0
Right.	More to the point. Where's our host?	0
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?	It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.	0
You coming back?	How could I stay away?	0
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?	What would you like? Texas?	0
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.	Then don't do it.	0
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.	I get it. You can drop it now.	0
Finn -	Yes.	0
I'm helping George build his house.	What?	0
Are we smart enough to avoid that?	There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you...	0
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --	A stimulant.	0
Buttfucks the cabin?	Let it go.	0
Whips...orange whips.	But you used to say --	0
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.	Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...	0
He's asleep.	Always?	0
Where are we going?	After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?	0
Well, I met someone...	Fast work. You just moved here.	0
David? How'd you get this number?	Walk to the window. Right in front of you.	0
So what are you thinking?	We're out of a job.	0
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.	Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...	0
You have a lot of secrets.	I guess.	0
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.	Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'	0
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.	0
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!	Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.	0
Who is there?	Will Shakespeare!	0
Santos... I can't...	Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.	0
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.	How do you know?	0
M'hm.	Do you have to be so damn forthright?	0
Were you planning to tell me?	Oh yeah, and then what?	0
I have no secrets from my family.	Loretta, I can't marry you.	0
No, you weren't	Then why'd you ask?	0
What do you want?	Yes.	0
Are you going to be able to sleep?	No, sir, WHAT?	0
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.	The maitre d' called you Christine.	0
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.	I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?	0
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.	Yeah it was all just an accident.	0
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.	Who wants true? Who wants moving?	0
You didn't say what it was for, did you?	No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?	0
Look, I've been working this case for months now...	So what's your story?	0
Who is he?	You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.	0
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?	Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?	0
So. There we are.	Don't catch cold.	0
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.	Now you're lying.	0
How did you get in the house?	He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.	0
How?  How were we the same people?	Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.	0
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!	He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?	0
...yes.	To him.	0
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?	Would you have believed me?	0
You've heard this story before?	No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.	0
I'm not made of glass.	Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.	0
Mm.	"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.	0
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.	Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.	0
Uh, hold on...	That kid... the hairdresser.	0
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?	Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.	0
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.	You really need to be fucked.	0
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.	I said I wouldn't.	0
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.	So why did you come to my casino?	0
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.	Those are gifts.	0
Consider it your musical education.	You're mushing it a little around the--	0
But you were pulling your hips last night.	So...Wanta make love?	0
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.	No you didn't.	0
Why, mother?	Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.	0
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.	Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --	0
Sit down!	If you want.  But...	0
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.	I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.	0
Um-hm.	Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!	0
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.	Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.	0
Where?	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.	0
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.	I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.	0
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.	But I'm the Commander!	0
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.	0
Yes... I know, Chauncey.	I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...	0
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...	Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.	0
I'm kidding. Hello?	Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...	0
then why did you marry her -	It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.	0
Money?	Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.	0
Then I'm doing fine.	So?	0
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.	We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.	0
Okay?	And a *lot* of paper!	0
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...	We never went to bed together.	0
Alex.	I was. What are you reading?	0
Who's nobody?	Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?	0
And are they going to get it?	...take a long view.	0
See my nipples?	They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...	0
I sit. I think. I play games.	Then you shouldn't have to ask.	0
Up.	It's the best collection I've ever seen.	0
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.	Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?	0
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?	You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?	0
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.	The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --	0
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?	Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.	0
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."	I like to read.	0
What's that?	Will you marry me?	0
Are we goin' home, John?	Ssh...	0
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.	What's wrong with her -- ?	0
Pow.	You got me.	0
Virgin sacrifices?	Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!	0
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?	Do you really think I care?	0
Hi.	Oh. Hi, how y'doing?	0
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.	Now husband and wife.	0
You all right?	A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.	0
Why--don't you like him?	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--	0
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.	I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!	0
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.	You think I'm creative?	0
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?	You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!	0
I would think so.	I'm glad we didn't.	0
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.	That one did.	0
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.	That's my girl...  Lights.	0
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --	But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!	0
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.	No, I don't have one.	0
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --	Now, Fran --	0
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	0
Would you knock it off, Sam?	I'm just tryin' to figure it out.	0
Just like it.	And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...	0
You really wear that suit.	I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.	0
I don't know.	What was your mother like?	0
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.	Go learn something.	0
What?	Maybe you resent how busy I've been.	0
Oh Hudson...	I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...	0
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?	No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.	0
Do you see anything you like?	Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.	0
I can't.	Car pool?	0
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.	Late.	0
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?	0
He's the kind liked it.	Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.	0
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?	I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.	0
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?	Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?	0
Are you alright?	He does landscapes.	0
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.	Talk about what?	0
Be careful.	Of course, I'll be careful.	0
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.	I didn't say it bothered me.	0
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.	Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...	0
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.	Yeah. It smells like snow.	0
That doesn't sound like him.	Well, I need to see this with an audience!	0
Three bullets! Any good?	What about a drink on the way home?	0
Uh-huh.	Who is this?	0
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.	He treats you okay?	0
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.	I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.	0
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?	Yes, sweetheart.	0
Well, I always liked you, Mike.	I always liked ya so much...	0
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.	I don't want to be.	0
I'm so very sad.	Yeah, but please don't do that.	0
May I ask where youíre from, Mr Lamont?	Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.	0
How long before this car's hot?	Great.	0
You were reading my Renoir.	How did you know?	0
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.	Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?	0
Paul Lamont...?	Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"	0
Why? What did she tell you?	What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?	0
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.	I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!	0
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.	What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?	0
Do you like my body?	So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?	0
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.	0
Yes I did, I'm sorry.	God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.	0
You...	Oh, my...	0
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.	Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.	0
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.	What did you hear?	0
-- Your act only works with an audience.	My act?!	0
No.	No what?	0
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.	I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?	0
So we'll meet him, then?	Sure... I'll see you around.	0
Yeah.	Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.	0
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Cameron.	0
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --	Of course.	0
What'll they do to him?	So I'm learning.	0
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.	How'd they get it inside?	0
Alice is dead?	No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.	0
No, it's not.  It's for this.	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.	0
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.	I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.	0
Jason.. Can you hear me?	He's home.  I heard the car.	0
I'm here.	We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?	0
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.	Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.	0
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.	Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.	0
That's not what I heard.	What was that, then?	0
Jesus was not bad.	Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.	0
Somebody's come. Already.	I want to be near you!	0
It's not nonsense.	Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.	0
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	You get Hardy.	0
What happened to Len Tashka?	Hey, baby! Where are you?	0
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!	I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.	0
Jesse, God - what happened?	'We?'	0
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?	No.	0
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this...	0
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.	So where do you go from here?	0
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?	Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.	0
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.	0
This was very sweet of you.	Not any more.	0
He had his hand on her titty.	It's okay.	0
Where do you keep the can opener?	In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.	0
--when you go away.	We could go together one day.	0
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?	What would you call it?	0
Can we make it?	I think you're in anaphylactic shock --	0
Like what?	Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?	0
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.	What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?	0
This morning.	Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.	0
Yeah, okay... whatever.	Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.	0
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?	Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.	0
What do you think?	Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.	0
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.	What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.	0
Eddie, are you okay?	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.	0
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.	You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.	0
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...	What? What?!	0
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...	Do you think that's what he wants?	0
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.	I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.	0
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.	......and this is confidential?	0
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.	What theory?	0
Why?	Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.	0
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.	Who taught you be be a nurse?	0
What just happened?	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?	0
No, you don't.	How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.	0
A good lay.	And look what I got.	0
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.	Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.	0
Why?	To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.	0
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.	You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.	0
You feel it?  It's different this time.	I myself --	0
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.	And how did Lamar become involved?	0
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.	What do you mean by that, Dolores?	0
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.	You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.	0
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.	Doesn't the isolation bother you?	0
Why are they under there?	Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.	0
The kid. Junior.	Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.	0
It's my fault.	Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...	0
Hi Josh.	Hi.	0
Well there's something new.	I need to... um... talk to you.	0
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?	It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.	0
That's crazy -- why not?	Why?	0
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?	I want to go home.	0
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?	Claire...	0
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?	I don't want to talk about it.	0
I got a dress.	Yeah?	0
This stuff is so sticky.	Claire.	0
Yes, I do.	Where are you headed?	0
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --	And that's what you've heard?	0
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?	That's why I asked you...	0
I'm at the hospital.	Yeah, sure.	0
What is?	Forget it.	0
Dinoine chagantakat!	I imagine that'd be rather difficult.	0
Admiration?  My my.	I thought I did.	0
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.	Paul will calm down. You'll see.	0
What do you want with my dad?	Business.	0
Well...	We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.	0
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Don't stop now.	0
Take something off.	Calm down --	0
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.	No, no, it's different.	0
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.	They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.	0
How can you say that, Sailor?	That's not your line.	0
Have him committed.	Yeah! That's thinking.	0
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?	You don't believe me, see for yourself.	0
Go on.	And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.	0
Yes it was all you --	Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.	0
Well I don't know.	Whatever you say, Jude...	0
Dance with me...	You know I can't.	0
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.	Hallie?	0
Yeah, well, don't let it get out	Two weeks.	0
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.	Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.	0
How many?	... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.	0
Entered our minds.	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.	0
I don't know. He has pains.	And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.	0
Well...	I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?	0
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.	I'm not a stalker.	0
Then light the match, Paul.	You're crazy baby.  I love you.	0
He wants me to come to his quarters.	I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?	0
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?	I don't know. Probably not.	0
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --	Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.	0
What?	When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.	0
Did you hear that?	Sera...	0
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?	On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.	0
You saw all that in one glimpse?	Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!	0
Used to what?	I'm different.	0
Hey, we're connected.	Jennifer, you want to have another drink?	0
Don? Are you in with them?	Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!	0
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.	Thanks.	0
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.	I'm not asking for us to be together.	0
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?	0
I like it better when I'm on top.	He offered you money?	0
She's gone.	What?	0
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.	Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...	0
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?	Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.	0
I put up new drapes, Jake.	I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?	0
What?  Beth?  My Beth?	Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."	0
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?	Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.	0
Peter, let go of the chair!	I'm not sure I hear a question in there?	0
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--	Yes or no.	0
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!	0
It won't.	Ssssh!	0
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.	From my dad's side of the family.	0
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.	He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.	0
I shall be all right.	You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.	0
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?	Yes...	0
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...	A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.	0
I see you're still having problems with your openings.	And this Jeremy--	0
That's...a comfort to hear.	I have a problem.	0
Do you still keep your key under the mat?	I know, I know.	0
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.	I left the training early.	0
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?	I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.	0
Occasionally, but always with affection.	And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.	0
How long have you been watching me?	I have something I have to show you...	0
I've run out of words.	You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --	0
No.	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?	0
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.	That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miamió  for the love of it?	0
Hello, Bob, it's me.	Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.	0
Brad, please lets get out of here.	They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....	0
My ass ain't the same.	Bigger?	0
Sure... What's Grace up to?	Yep.	0
May I ask your name?	My name is Chance.	0
Are you gonna tell me where you went?	I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.	0
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -	A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.	0
I guess.	Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.	0
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?	Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.	0
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...	Forget it.	0
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.	Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.	0
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.	Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.	0
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.	I was the more deceived.	0
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.	0
Why do you ask?	Just an idle question.	0
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.	What?	0
What about the moon?	Did you see it?	0
John Doe.	You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.	0
What's that?	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.	0
Alice got married again.	She did?	0
Oh, okay. I think I get it.	What do you get?	0
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?	What does your lawyer think?	0
Is that true?	I don't know.	0
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?	I'll wait.	0
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.	How do you know?	0
I'll tuck you in.	You can't seduce me.	0
Wait a second --	Just make yourself comfortable.	0
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.	It's not a village. There's nothing there.	0
Yeah, no, I see --	And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!	0
Yeah.	...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...	0
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.	You don't look eighty.	0
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?	Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.	0
How about if I try humility.	Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?	0
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?	I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.	0
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.	No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.	0
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.	Good night.	0
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.	I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.	0
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?	My mind's lovely.  And yours?	0
So that was your pudding?	Yeah.	0
You okay?	Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.	0
What kind of food?	You betcha.	0
I wonder.	On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?	0
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.	Sure, no problem.	0
Hello, my little boy.	Oh, yah?	0
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.	Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.	0
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?	I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-	0
Now, what do you want?	It's a huge moment in their life --	0
Did you know that?	What?  Who?	0
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.	0
What is it?	Open it...	0
I told you, something's upset them.	Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.	0
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.	I'm drinking.	0
Turn it up, Magda.	Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.	0
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.	Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.	0
Did you make any change in this room?	I don't think so.	0
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!	0
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.	Tell me more about yourself.	0
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?	To pay for the next expedition, of course.	0
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find åem.	If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.	0
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?	I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.	0
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.	Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...	0
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.	I can't just walk away!	0
Most of them.	Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --	0
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.	Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.	0
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?	Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.	0
Well then what are you trying to do-	This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.	0
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'	Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.	0
About three months before I met you.	Why?	0
Harmless - how?	Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?	0
They're not just our business managers, Panes.	Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.	0
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.	Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.	0
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?	Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.	0
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.	Partly.  But partly, you're mad.	0
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?	Take your time.	0
That's an affirmative.	That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...	0
What's the matter with your leg?	I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.	0
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!	Really?	0
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.	Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?	0
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.	I've already got more help than I need.	0
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.	You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.	0
I don't care, Dad. I love you.	I love you too, Francie.	0
It was the best time of his life.	How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.	0
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?	Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...	0
Tennessee?	Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!	0
I'm coming with you.	Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?	0
My imagination isn't that good.	Let's go.	0
Where's your dad?	For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.	0
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?	0
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.	Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.	0
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.	That bad huh?	0
You're pressuring yourself...	No... no...	0
Just take a look at it.	If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?	0
Watch out, you're on my hair!	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.	0
So what's wrong with that?	Okay.	0
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...	Well, why stop at that?	0
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.	I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.	0
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?	Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.	0
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?	Yeah, I know it's small.	0
She was a liar, she was a liar!	Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?	0
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.	"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...	0
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.	Y'think?	0
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?	Maybe... someday.  Not today.	0
That's great. I -- didn't know.	Get the hell out!	0
I don't want to hear about her anymore.	Never.	0
What do you want from me?	I, I don't know.	0
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.	That you didn't die?  Like the other children?	0
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?	That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.	0
Huh?	I just saw a man walk out of your room.	0
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.	Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.	0
I'm relieved you said that.	You said a woman likes to be pursued.	0
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?	Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.	0
Please, please try one more time.	I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.	0
Where're you going to go?	I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.	0
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.	No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.	0
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I donít want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Iím not sure he knew that.	Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.	0
Of course I knew.	That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.	0
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.	Just like that?	0
And you're going to fall for them.	By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.	0
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.	No rawness.	0
... I'm sorry, sir?	What are those mirrors for?	0
Barely.	I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?	0
Phil for God sake.	Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.	0
You mean you know about this?	Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?	0
What are you going to do?	Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?	0
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.	This kid just wants his freedom.	0
What?	No you won't.	0
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.	Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?	0
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?	What the hell is that?	0
Marry you?	That's right.  Will you marry me?	0
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.	You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.	0
Why would we go to Odessa?	It's all over, babe, it's all over.	0
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.	We should get you to the doctor.	0
Oh! Something bit me, too!	Now come on - you're acting silly --	0
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.	It's the truth.	0
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.	He left!	0
I understand, mister. It means something, really.	Can I see you again?	0
Yeah.	Who set it up?  Eric?	0
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.	Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.	0
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...	You know what I mean.	0
Is something the matter?	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.	0
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.	Oh.  No.	0
He's trying.	Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.	0
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.	I do.	0
Wick.  They got your crew, too?	Why would you care?	0
How'd you find out?	It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.	0
Sorry.	Are they moulting now?	0
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?	I thought you wasn't comin'.	0
Why are you asking me this?	Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?	0
I don't like it!	No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!	0
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.	Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.	0
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?	Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.	0
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.	Yeah.	0
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!	Hand me the canula.	0
I'm getting married.	Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...	0
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.	Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?	0
You didn't drive her mad.	Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.	0
Brian?	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.	0
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.	Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.	0
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.	How did they execute him?	0
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?	Okey-doke.	0
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.	I think I'm going to stay up for a while.	0
He was killed.	Killed? Why do you use that word?	0
This feels like something out of a spy novel.	It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.	0
You went to those brain butchers?!	What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.	0
So...how's the knee?	We have that in common.	0
What else don't you believe in?	I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.	0
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.	You wanna come?	0
Sit down.	Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.	0
You all right?	I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?	0
Ay me!	She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!	0
It's really nice up here, isn't it?	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.	0
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.	It was only a mouthful!	0
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!	So do I. Over and over.	0
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.	I'd rather not.	0
Alex? Where are you going?	To see if there's a pub.	0
Hon?	My reputation seems to have preceded me.	0
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.	Oh, come on.	0
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...	I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, thereís no question about that.  But this...  ...youíve really grown into a beautiful woman...	0
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.	I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.	0
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.	Gooood!	0
Isn't there something you want to tell me?	To tell you?	0
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.	Did she tell you where she was callin' from?	0
Who's that sitting in your car?	You scared me.	0
The what?	So what?	0
I want my fucking money --	I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?	0
Oh, no!	Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do itó	0
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.	What??	0
Oh please.	I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?	0
She insulted me!	Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --	0
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.	What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?	0
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?	Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.	0
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.	Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.	0
I talked you into this?	I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.	0
Yes. Yes, it does.	It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...	0
No.	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.	0
What are you doing?	I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.	0
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.	I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.	0
What?	-- just --	0
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?	It's really not about anything.	0
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.	What do you want me to see?	0
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.	He's alright, but my Dad can take him.	0
You're pretty charming when you want to be.	Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.	0
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?	You might still have a house.	0
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.	[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.	0
No.	Tell them I'm not.	0
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.	He's made some friends, hasn't he?	0
I see.	You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?	0
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?	No thanks.	0
I can't name anybody she does like these days.	I see she built a place up here by the river.	0
Now, whyn't you help us?	I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.	0
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.	Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?	0
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.	I just wanted to see you.	0
Hmmmph.	Gabby, what is it?	0
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.	I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.	0
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.	A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.	0
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.	... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.	0
You don't?	No. What is happening?	0
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...	Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.	0
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.	Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?	0
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.	Yeah I know.  So what do we do?	0
Mine.	Your baby?	0
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--	Oh, but this one is so simple.	0
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...	So you were never a prostitute?	0
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?	0
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.	Makes her look even more innocent.	0
Why didn't you tell me?	Yes.	0
The systems integration site.	Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.	0
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!	What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?	0
I never joke about money.	Namely?	0
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?	No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -	0
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?	Don't worry.	0
Why?	If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.	0
Don't be too harsh.	Is he your boyfriend?	0
Shouldn't we care about everybody?	What a fruitcake you are!	0
Your mother's not dead.	Well, that was plan A.	0
Are there any special instructions?	...What?	0
I don't like your following me.	No, I didn't.	0
Today coffee----	Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.	0
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?	I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...	0
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?	Em iram! Em iram!	0
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.	No, I don't want to be rude.	0
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !	Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?	0
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.	A deeper level?	0
No, she was heavily sedated.	It's serious?	0
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.	What happened to Mandrake the Magician?	0
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.	Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.	0
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.	Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.	0
Hold that thought.	Why should I trust you?	0
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.	It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.	0
Are you out of your mind?	I donít think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Weíll put Annie and Josh in private schools...	0
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?	I don't know.	0
This is my good John Brown.	Yes.	0
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.	0
What makes you think things will be any different this time?	Let's dig in!	0
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!	You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?	0
How do you know?	What about us?	0
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.	Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.	0
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?	No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.	0
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --	I'm ready.	0
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.	Dogs?	0
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.	Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.	0
None of this was here before.	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.	0
Where'd you leave 'em?	I don't know.	0
They know, don't they?	Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.	0
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.	I had no thought of offending you, Oona.	0
What're you gonna do next?	Try some other ways.	0
You look tired....	I'm fine....	0
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.	Well?	0
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.	They're all divorced?	0
-- wit...nesses --	How many men since then?	0
For instance - you!	This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-	0
No...	My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.	0
Then I'll be there for you.	You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.	0
But there's one thing I envy you for.	What's that?	0
Shit.	Very good, Madam.	0
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.	So do I.	0
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.	How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?	0
Where?	Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --	0
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.	Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.	0
Oh tsht. Yes.	That's great.	0
What's your middle name?	He suggested I ask you.	0
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.	Just tell a little white lie?	0
Where is she then?	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.	0
Are you...okay?	It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.	0
This is a mammal, not a fish.	Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.	0
I know.	How do you know?	0
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.	I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.	0
Two days?	The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.	0
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!	Most things.  We're very high on purpose.	0
That's normal.	Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.	0
You couldn't have known --	Yeah, I could've. Should've.	0
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.	At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life óó that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.	0
Are you really a virgin?	M'm.	0
I don't know, I don't care.	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.	0
You mean did I write it before my parents died?	I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.	0
No.	Why not?	0
Nine years?	Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.	0
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?	No.	0
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?	I don't know what I've done.	0
He did?	I'll be back when we lose.	0
He was a President.	President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.	0
No.	There's nothing sudden about tható  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.	0
What do you drink? Bourbon?	Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?	0
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?	From what?	0
I love you, Nick...	Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.	0
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?	I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.	0
A what?	For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.	0
Really?	Really. You want to dance with someone else?	0
Right now?	Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.	0
Fifteen years, huh?	Fifteen years, yeah.	0
I wrote the letter.	She is not your birth mother, is she?	0
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?	Cynthia, I don't know.	0
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.	And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?	0
Right.	Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.	0
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.	It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.	0
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.	0
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --	Say what you want and you'll see --	0
But the power...	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...	0
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.	Not entirely. No.	0
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?	Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.	0
Good luck, Sebastian.	No.	0
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.	Sad? What made you sad?	0
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.	Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?	0
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!	Steady...	0
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -	That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.	0
Oh, Jim!	No.	0
Why not?	What?	0
Peter's brother?  But --	Half-brother to be precise.	0
What are you doing?	Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --	0
Don't!	Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.	0
Blade.	Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!	0
In braids? That's right.	Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth wereó	0
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.	So why'd you give up ball?	0
No, it was a complete waste of time.	This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.	0
Stop staring. Do a vase.	Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.	0
You're damn right I'm serious....	Marylin!	0
We, we have to give it.	...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...	0
Who's gun is that?	You wanna drink?	0
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.	Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...	0
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.	Come on! come on!	0
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --	Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.	0
What does this mean to you?	WHY?	0
You shouldn't have.	He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.	0
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?	No -- why should I?	0
I got an awful bad cold.	Tough day.	0
Lie. That's one. Keep going.	A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.	0
No way.	Why?!  I think she's very attractive.	0
That's what I know.	The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.	0
How long does it have to be a new house?	I don't have all day.	0
Why not?	You getting into bed to think about yellow?	0
No thanks.	Coffee?	0
And Bourne? Where's he now?	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?	0
What do you think happened on this boat?	No! No!	0
Say it in English.	Then we'll be right where we are now.	0
If that's how you feel --	But it's not.	0
Did you warn her?	She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...	0
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!	But Lana, you could --	0
I know ...	It's hard to lose ...	0
Fine.	School?	0
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.	What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?	0
Of course not. Who wants to? Whatís the point if we donít get caught? Whereís the glamour in that?	Now, really -	0
She's only perfect.	Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.	0
What's going to happen to Dolores?	I think he's going to the john.	0
I still am.	Yes, sweetheart.	0
Calvin?!	Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?	0
You seem very sure about that.	I'm absolutely positive.	0
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.	Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.	0
What's that?	I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.	0
Then maybe you're ready.	For what?	0
What's that supposed to mean?	It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.	0
Yeah?	Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.	0
It just proves that the difference we have are...	Have you ever been to that station?	0
I don't want it now.	Where are you going?	0
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.	What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...	0
What does it look like?	No one else in here?	0
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.	Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellóO for me, Mom.'	0
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?	What makes you say that?	0
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.	Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.	0
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.	Keep away!	0
What are you doing?	Dammit, Janet.	0
No thanks.	Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.	0
What do you mean, a part of Harry?	When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.	0
It's undamaged?	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.	0
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...	The dead can wait.	0
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.	I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.	0
Will? Are you okay?	He'll, what else can I do with it all?	0
I never said you were "nothing".	No, thank you. I have my car.	0
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--	Whoah, what a day, huh?	0
What a horrible little person.	Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --	0
Johnny!	Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.	0
It seems right to us.	If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?	0
What are you researching?	I guess somebody beat me to it.	0
The fall alone would kill you.	Do you love me, Rose?	0
Travis, you haven't even played the record?	Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.	0
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!	Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.	0
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.	Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.	0
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.	What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.	0
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.	Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.	0
Really?  It makes me sick.	No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.	0
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?	Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.	0
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.	What's your being married got to do with it?	0
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.	For real?	0
What is with you tonight?	I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.	0
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.	I'm going... I'm going.	0
To all those cons...	Searching for a money man...	0
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.	Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.	0
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?	Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.	0
What?	Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?	0
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.	0
Not you. Youíre not disgusting. Youíre lovely. Just the idea that theyíd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnít...who never.... I mean, someoneís dead.	Thatís right. Imagine facing it alone.	0
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?	No. Never again.	0
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.	Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?	0
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.	Well, I wasn't going to say that --	0
What did they say?	Gosh, you look pretty tonight.	0
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.	You're the dead.	0
Please -- please!	He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.	0
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?	No!!!	0
Humans.	Who?	0
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.	0
It was fine.	I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.	0
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?	Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.	0
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.	The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.	0
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.	I did.	0
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.	I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.	0
So you were at Berkeley.	I was not.	0
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.	You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.	0
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--	Pilar--	0
And what do you tell yourself now?	Nothing. It's over.	0
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...	Why should you care?	0
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?	Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.	0
Bully for you.	Range 3000 meters and closing.	0
What?	The Red Sox	0
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?	No.	0
Old Howard Winton's cub?	That's the one.	0
Where are they?	For what?	0
Please? What friends?	I don't have much time.	0
Why not?	I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.	0
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?	I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...	0
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.	High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.	0
Hmm.  Pretty good.	Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.	0
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --	Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.	0
It's the bitterest of pills.	Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.	0
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.	Well, it isn't.	0
You don't believe me.	I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.	0
How old's Annette?	I don't care.	0
That's too bad.	What do you know about the ear? Anything?	0
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.	Take the rope.	0
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.	I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.	0
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.	Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.	0
What do you do for a living?	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womanóa trip like this.	0
How can you ask me that?	You're making me feel guilty again.	0
How bad is it?	Yeah. Come on.	0
Of course.	In cash.	0
In the South Wing.	No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.	0
I wish you'd tell me who.	Shit.	0
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!	We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.	0
What does that mean?	"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?	0
That slut!	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.	0
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.	Why did you quit?	0
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.	Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.	0
You two know each other?	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?	0
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?	You're back.	0
No.	A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.	0
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!	You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?	0
What about Keith?	Keep 'em there for a little while.	0
You think I should do Henry James instead?	We have that in common.	0
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?	I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.	0
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.	I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?	0
Why?	You don't like to see me enjoying myself.	0
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?	Right.	0
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --	Good luck...	0
Good morning.	Let the hooker go.  She's not important.	0
I was tired.	The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.	0
Cone.	Huh... what cone?	0
Bad?	Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...	0
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!	Yes, I like you.	0
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...	Over the water department, or over you?	0
I have feelings for you.	A bride without a head!	0
You don't look very happy to see me.	That would complicate things.	0
You didn't have to beat him up!	I will.	0
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --	-- no, like what, what do you mean?	0
Thanks, honey.	We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.	0
...you...	I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.	0
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?	Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?	0
I hate funny exit lines.	Who was the trunk addressed to?	0
Lick me.	It does matter. We're in love.	0
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.	Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.	0
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.	0
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.	All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.	0
No, I didn't know that.	What?	0
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.	You are...	0
What's on Thursdays?	It's the crews' night off.	0
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.	Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?	0
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.	How'd you get up here?	0
It was a long time ago -	Don't you remember what they called you?	0
That was about a year ago.	I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.	0
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.	Maude?	0
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.	Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?	0
Changed?	What?	0
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.	I'd a found you, Ma.	0
You never spoke to me before.	Rough day on the set?	0
Come on.	But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.	0
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.	I thought I did.	0
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.	0
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?	You let him pierce his nose?	0
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.	You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.	0
Just like that?  You were in prison?	No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.	0
Don't touch me.	You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.	0
Where?	It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.	0
So youíre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thatís a down payment on a Ford Focus!	Not dollars. Pounds.	0
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --	I am.	0
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?	Uh-uh.	0
Great.	Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?	0
You're shouting at me.	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.	0
The Wizard of Gore?	It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.	0
How?	Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.	0
We decided...	You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....	0
Sabotage?	You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!	0
Tell me once more.	I don't love you.	0
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?	I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.	0
Since this morning.	Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.	0
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?	Yeah, right here.	0
Talk? To you? After what you did!	I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?	0
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...	Yes. John wants it.	0
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.	But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.	0
Nice friend.	Yeah.	0
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...	0
You mean the time you're locked away?	No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.	0
...What a knucklehead.	Who?	0
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.	I know who you are.	0
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.	Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.	0
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...	A funny story?	0
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.	0
What did you wish for, Adam?	A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.	0
Nice work, Captain sir.	-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.	0
Please let me go with you.	No.	0
Enough.	To old friends.  And your new dreams.	0
Has someone seen to those bruises?	It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.	0
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?	0
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.	How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?	0
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?	Marcia, please.	0
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?	You're great.	0
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?	You're losing me.	0
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.	Why would you do that?	0
...yes.	Look -- it ticks!	0
Gay?	No.	0
Erik. You don't understand.	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.	0
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...	Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.	0
What were you doing there?	No, it can't be, because he's a comic.	0
I took a cab.	Oh, I doubt that's the case.	0
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	What! You can't be --	0
I wouldn't know.	A sponsor.	0
Oh yeah?	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?	0
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.	Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?	0
The Police, then...	Don't drown.	0
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.	0
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.	Right... OK...	0
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.	A paper?	0
What are you doing out here?	At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.	0
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.	About her upcoming wedding and all.	0
Look--I think we ought to skip it.	All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--	0
What?	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.	0
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?	You saying you didn't ?	0
Is that anything?	Thank you.	0
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?	Yes.	0
And now?	No.	0
I didn't get any chicken.	How come?	0
How d'you mean?	Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...	0
Not much.	Did you?	0
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Uh... Yes, of course!	0
Do you?	Yes, I do.	0
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.	I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.	0
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?	0
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...	0
How the... did he get in there?	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.	0
No.	Oh, sorry. Right this way.	0
I suppose. But what if you want to live?	So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.	0
Because I don't want to.	Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.	0
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?	What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?	0
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.	Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.	0
So what's happening with your book?	Universally rejected. Strike three.	0
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?	So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.	0
I'm the stenographer.	Then you will please wait outside.	0
But.	Hush, baby.	0
I did. Are you?	Me and my dad.	0
Name it.	Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.	0
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .	Why, I needed aó	0
Shit! The house is on fire!	"And your children all gone."	0
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?	When are you leaving Berlin?	0
Yeah? You sure?	What kind of treatment?	0
All street mimes should be executed.	... Looks like a convention.	0
I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.	0
You drive like a maniac!	Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.	0
Who?	Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.	0
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.	Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.	0
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.	Why not?	0
Forget it!	Look.	0
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.	Already? All these letters?	0
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.	You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?	0
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.	Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.	0
No.	So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?	0
Been here long?	Shut up!	0
I don't know him that well.	Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?	0
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.	It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.	0
I don't believe it.	I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.	0
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.	Oh.	0
You made me look like an idiot --	Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.	0
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.	Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.	0
Sounds like a threat.	I'm glad you do.	0
What's that?	It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.	0
Holding hands?	No, not holding hands.	0
Don't bother!	What?	0
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?	What's that?	0
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!	That's what your man is supposed to do.	0
Hi, Barney!	I'm going to bed now.	0
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?	0
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.	Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?	0
Get out of my house. Youíre fired, Mr Lombard.	Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.	0
Yeah.	Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?	0
What did you find?	I'll be there.	0
How about music?  You like classical?	The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.	0
You wanna dance?	Why?	0
Where... where you going?	What will Aubrey think?	0
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?	Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.	0
Then give me your word you won't.	"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.	0
Like you?	I don't have to go through with it either.	0
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.	0
You all act like two roosters.	Yeahówith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?	0
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.	Or teach it a better tune.	0
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.	How about Bari?	0
Of course.	Yeah, bu-bu-but why?	0
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.	Who is this?  It's Tom.	0
Not as long as I'm alive.	You have not slept with your husband for five years?	0
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.	I don't understand.	0
I got eggs down here!	Jesus.	0
I look terrible.	Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.	0
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?	Why?	0
You move well.	What makes him so special?	0
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?	No, I do. I want to tell you.	0
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.	You don't say!	0
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --	Just a minute.	0
I think itís good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Itís very human.	But you always seem so certain.	0
You're not really serious about this, are you?	All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.	0
He do that every year?	Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?	0
He's afraid of something.	Let me come in.	0
He's a good man.	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.	0
Barely.	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?	0
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!	All right.  Mission accomplished.	0
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?	I hear that's a rather popular date.	0
Daisy. How did you know?	What the fuck is going on?	0
How do we start?	I turn on the camera. You start talking.	0
No.	It's not my line.	0
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.	-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.	0
What do you mean?	For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?	0
I'm walking.	Talking's good, walking's better.	0
Uhh, no.	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.	0
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.	Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!	0
So have I.  ... Hello?	What?	0
You like shoes?	I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--	0
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.	Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?	0
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?	I love her.	0
You seem fascinated by the stars.	Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...	0
Where's Corbett?	Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.	0
Who told you?	I'm right?	0
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.	I was wrong.	0
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.	We were just studying.	0
Why the math?	Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?	0
Just a minute, you!	I was wrong.	0
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...	I just talked to her.	0
What? Oh, I'm...busy.	Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.	0
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.	0
You're positive of that, aren't you?	Absolutely sure.	0
Really, Frank?  When was that?	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.	0
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!	Did you.  What was that in aid of?	0
Oh yes, of course.	Do?	0
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.	You take a lot for granted.	0
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.	What?	0
There. That's right.	She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.	0
Ich said you left.	There was a change in plans.	0
Who are you?	Couldnít make it. Splitting headache.	0
That's a dumb thing to say.	Four.	0
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.	Frost.	0
Everything, but everything.	Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?	0
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!	I believe we share an art instructor	0
With Trina.	Mm.	0
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.	OK.	0
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!	... Okay.	0
It's where I live.	I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.	0
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --	These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?	0
What do you mean "on his way up"!?	I just buzzed him in.	0
I'm sorry.	That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.	0
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.	Not for the weekend.  For the summer.	0
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?	There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.	0
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.	I don't want Caitlin...	0
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.	It was perfect.	0
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.	Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --	0
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.	Otherwise, you're not ugly.	0
Yeah.	That's Carlotta Valdes.	0
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.	Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.	0
Hello....congratulations.	Jean Baptiste!	0
But you're a girl, thank goodness.	Yeah.	0
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.	There's that spice again.	0
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.	I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--	0
You better not have too much joy.	What're you doing three dates from now?	0
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?	Eleven.	0
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.	Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?	0
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.	Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?	0
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.	Mm. Hm.	0
Colwyn ...	You must move away from the Center.	0
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.	I thought we were poor.	0
Say my name.	Gabrielle.	0
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?	Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...	0
You're not answering me.	Is she against you getting help?	0
I want to ride my own bike.	Men!	0
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.	0
He's in Palermo.	What's wrong can never be made right.	0
-- did she talk to you?	She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.	0
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--	That one?	0
That's not my ring.	Not your...	0
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?	Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.	0
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.	What?	0
I can't believe you're taking his side.	I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.	0
You know your history.	I know my treasure.	0
Nothing?	This is a great young out-of-work actress.	0
Sounds good.	I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.	0
Jimmy... it's beautiful!	Yeah.	0
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.	More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.	0
Yes?	Yeah, I know it's small.	0
No you don't.	What's wrong with your son, anyway?	0
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --	Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.	0
Kill him.	Course not.	0
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.	I really donít like that comparison, honey.	0
Hi.	Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.	0
Jesus, Mulder...	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...	0
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.	Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.	0
I'm sorry.	Then we should have had lunch at the bank.	0
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.	Yeah, it is.	0
You can't just pull the plug, David.	It's not like you've given me much choice.	0
He wouldn't.	One. Here, in front of my ear.	0
Isn't he a salesman?	You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.	0
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.	He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.	0
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?	What?	0
You're kidding. When for?	Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.	0
What did he say exactly? I mean, you donít think he wants me back?	Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.	0
What's happened?	Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.	0
Why don't you just call him up?	What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?	0
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!	Alright... okay...	0
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?	I like it.	0
What is it you want me to do?	I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?	0
<u>Who</u>?	The south pole.  Timeπs flowing backwards.	0
Sometimes. Afterward.	Just till I lose.	0
Any word on my Dad?	Is he all right?	0
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.	0
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.	A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.	0
I'm not pregnant.	Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?	0
No you're not!	Why not?	0
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?	...I understand...	0
You did say birds?	Why not?	0
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.	Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.	0
I must go. I'm in a hurry.	Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...	0
You want to fuck her?	Stop it.	0
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.	Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.	0
Will you bring it in to me?	I wish I did.	0
Is that customary?	It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.	0
Why do you have to defend her?	I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.	0
Flowers. That's funny.	As long as I get the laugh.	0
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.	You like Jack?	0
Go away! You've spoilt it.	All right, forget about it.	0
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.	0
Prison?	Why?	0
Fine. What do I do?	It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.	0
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.	I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.	0
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?	Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.	0
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.	0
Tell me about yourself.	I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.	0
I don't..	What kind of treatment?	0
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.	It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.	0
You move well.	Just trying to make it look real.	0
I am right! I know I'm right!	Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.	0
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...	Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.	0
No.	Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.	0
You did?	That's great.	0
Oh, dear.	Yes.	0
He ain't Spalding.	The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.	0
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --	Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --	0
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?	You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.	0
And that's not the same thing?	No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.	0
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!	Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.	0
No thanks.	Maybe it would if I took it.	0
And? Are you going to tell him?	No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.	0
What does that mean?	He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?	0
What happened?	Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.	0
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.	0
I know, but I've been thinking --	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--	0
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!	Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.	0
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.	Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.	0
But that's not like a real person at all.	I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.	0
So what. Infatuation is good, too.	And I didn't have an argument.	0
He's not, he's...	No, I'm look --	0
I never said that.	Same one you were reading the other night?	0
Well...How have you been?	Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.	0
So we found a compromise.	Or it found us.	0
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.	We were?	0
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.	Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.	0
Where did you go last night? What did you do?	I don't... I... I can't remember...	0
Oh, God...	Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.	0
Are we having a bad night?	Well, it is. It is that, too.	0
You are upset.	I'm not.	0
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.	Come here.	0
So it's all worked out perfectly...	Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...	0
You never cared before.	Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.	0
What are you doing here?	Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.	0
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.	In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.	0
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.	No, Dr. Grant says...	0
Why would you want to leave?	Can I?	0
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?	Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.	0
Lower your voice!	What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?	0
Where have you been?	I've been thinking--	0
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.	NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?	0
Washed away.	Because life is good.	0
What <i>is</i> this place?	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.	0
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?	Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.	0
Chauncey! Chauncey!	You had sex with you therapist?	0
You too?	I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.	0
...No... never in so many words...	December twenty-first.	0
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.	What did he say?	0
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?	He's a psycho! He'll kill you!	0
What are you doing?	I had training. In the Republic.	0
We have a baby?	Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.	0
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.	You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...	0
Huh! Really? Hotels?	West.	0
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.	I do. I'm -- are you...?	0
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.	0
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?	Uh. . .	0
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?	You're talking nonsense.	0
And am I not fair?	Wondrously so.	0
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.	I love you.	0
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....	We have it good, don't we?	0
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!	And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.	0
Stifler told me.	Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --	0
Where do you live?	They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.	0
This isn't happening.	Some things have to be endured...	0
Of course.	We can cut back at the end.	0
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.	Mm.	0
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.	It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.	0
Oh!	Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.	0
I need to know.	Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.	0
You don't need to do that.	I guess he didn't.	0
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--	He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.	0
Great movie. Action-packed!	No, you're not.	0
When did he lapse into the coma?	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.	0
I don't know anything about it.	She said she's got to be home by nine.	0
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.	Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	0
Oh Clark, no!	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !	0
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?	With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.	0
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.	It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.	0
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.	I'm just quiet.	0
So now they believe me.	I'm going to bed now.	0
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.	Three more chapters to go.	0
He works on the movie.	Why should I go?	0
You shut up. Who do you think you are?	Can hardly wait to do it again.	0
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...	Thanks just the same.	0
Annie. Annie Hayworth.	Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.	0
No.	Maybe a drink would help you.	0
What are you doing here?	And you think it's worth all this?	0
...I can't remember.	What?	0
You might hold this for me.	In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.	0
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.	That's not it.	0
Forged papers! Now, what?!	Now just get off the train.	0
Tank, you're hurt.	Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?	0
Yeah, it's good to get together.	Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?	0
What did he say?	He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.	0
No!	That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.	0
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.	I'll be right up.	0
And they just answer them?	No.	0
No I didn't.	Yes you did.	0
Erik. You don't understand.	Actually, I just had an amusing thought.	0
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.	I don't want them now.	0
There's a nice boy.	We need to find a way to make me part of it.	0
Why did he shoot her?	You know what I mean.	0
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?	It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.	0
So who left who?	I don't like to leave questions unanswered.	0
And do you trust me?	I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...	0
You think that'll help?	Who we gonna beat?	0
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.	I think she's great.	0
Then why are you shaking?	I don't know.  I'm happy.	0
...but you're not -- you're not sure...	We can't wait to be sure.	0
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.	What the fuck is going on?	0
A normal person.	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...	0
Who didn't?	You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.	0
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?	Don't be fooled by appearances.	0
Oh.	I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.	0
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.	Kelly!  What are you doing here?	0
Where's Sam?	Mexico.	0
Neo, how did you do that?	S'okay.  I know you still love me.	0
Come on.	Iíve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think itís the words: ìmorally repugnant.î	0
--Torn down in the name of convenience--	--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.	0
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.	It won't?	0
Modelling.	Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.	0
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.	Cigarette?	0
I don't think this is any time to be funny...	You know what we want.	0
It isn't any better.	You must listen to me before you go.	0
Five minutes.	Goodbye.	0
Let go of me...	Maybe he likes older women.	0
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.	What do you mean?	0
What's the obvious stuff?	I don't know.	0
What?	You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.	0
What will you do, Colonel?	Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?	0
Shoot.	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?	0
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?	Give him time.	0
Well...	Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.	0
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -	Where we'll always be...	0
There's a million birds here.	In that birch tree is a nest.	0
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?	No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.	0
A distinction worth noting ...	And here I am...	0
No I wasn't.	-- this guy with Jill.	0
What the crap?	It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?	0
Uh hum.	I know.  I can feel it too.	0
Do you think I did it?	Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.	0
What can I say? He does weird things to me.	Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.	0
Yes.	Well -- I don't know.	0
Stop nagging.	I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.	0
Don't litter my cab!	Oh, sorry.	0
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.	You're speaking of emotional investment?	0
I am sleepy.	They just don't want us going in there.	0
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.	Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.	0
Do you like quotes, Howard?	How do you mean?	0
I know...	I don't think you do.	0
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.	Does she know about us?	0
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --	I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.	0
Why's it here?	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--	0
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.	Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.	0
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.	I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.	0
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.	I'm getting to believe you.	0
We can't do that.	Why not ?	0
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.	A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?	0
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?	What's going on in there, Starck?	0
Nobody's saying they don't.	And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.	0
Sorry about your game.	Yes... probably he was renewed?	0
Yes...	That's not what happened to your parents.	0
Is that the one who died?	Something like that, yeah.	0
You know he hated my story also.	That bad huh?	0
You're positive of that, aren't you?	Yes!	0
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.	Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.	0
And you didn't tell her?	Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."	0
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!	You are, you are my only connection to the world!	0
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.	Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?	0
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.	Sure.	0
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.	It can't be possible.	0
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.	A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...	0
No.	You've been with someone!	0
Sure.	Define small.	0
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.	I'm ready to communicate with you now.	0
Ich said you left.	You know any good criminal lawyers?	0
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.	On the night table.	0
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?	Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.	0
Austin, may I have a word with you?	Of course, luv.	0
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?	C'mere.	0
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.	0
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?	Do you know him well?	0
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.	I know.	0
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.	I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.	0
You've done much of this work before?	I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!	0
Like what?	Like sticking his nose into other people's business.	0
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --	Tonight.	0
I don't see why not.	I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.	0
A little...	Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?	0
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.	Not in love, exactly, but...	0
That's great Earl!	They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?	0
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.	There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".	0
Hardly. You have six bedrooms	I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.	0
Somebody's got to do it--	Well, let's hear the poem--	0
I'm sorry.	Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.	0
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.	Do you like the colour?	0
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.	What'll it say?	0
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.	You know the other day, you asked why I came back?	0
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.	You know goddamn well what I mean.	0
No.	- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...	0
Please --	Right.	0
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.	Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.	0
Why?	To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.	0
What did you say?	I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.	0
I said, you understand what I'm saying	I understand woman, damn!	0
What a horrible little person.	She's from...France.	0
I almost didn't.	Lee... uh...	0
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.	That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?	0
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?	I have no idea - I just want to...	0
There's a young girl to see you.	What does she want?	0
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?	Because that's where I found it. I was there.	0
That's mature.	That's not good enough, Goddamit!	0
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?	How will you make sure Job will be there?	0
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?	I will appreciate that.	0
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.	I am.	0
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...	Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.	0
I know him too.	What?	0
I don't care.	Let us go, miss.	0
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.	So do you.	0
I want you to give up that terrible job.	Look who's here, Margo.	0
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.	0
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!	...you know?  I, uh...	0
I don't know.	Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other...	0
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.	I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.	0
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.	I'm not sailing with this thing on board!	0
What are you going to do with it?	Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.	0
What are you doing here?	In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.	0
He hasn't had breakfast yet.	It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.	0
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.	You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?	0
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...	Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.	0
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.	To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.	0
Where've you been?	Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.	0
What are you doing?	Oh, sorry.	0
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.	When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.	0
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.	Yeah.	0
Happy anniversary, baby.	Sunlight?	0
Shit.  It's my Galiano.	The secretary.  Or the file clerk.	0
Yours?	Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...	0
Any night.	Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!	0
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.	You know what that does to me.	0
I'll do my best.	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.	0
No, I'm serious.	So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.	0
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?	0
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.	He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.	0
What's the matter?	It's too rough.	0
A synthetic opium analogue.	Goodbye.	0
I refuse to resign!	We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?	0
Will it change my life?	Whatever you say.	0
What do you mean?	May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?	0
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.	That's exactly what I want you to do.	0
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?	Anyway. Sorry. Hi.	0
You don't miss it?	I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.	0
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.	I'm all ears.	0
Do you think I'm pretty?	Yes.	0
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?	No.	0
Well, what do you wanna talk about!	Is he sincere about wanting peace?	0
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.	I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.	0
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --	I suppose that's my fault.	0
Something like that.	Well... we're glad to have you.	0
I wouldn't do that...	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.	0
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..	Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?	0
I can use them.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?	0
Jill's really great, isn't she?	You'll be fine.	0
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?	It's like smoking without inhaling.	0
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.	I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.	0
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.	Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.	0
That's why I'm asking.	What time do you get finished?	0
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.	She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...	0
Crash, I didn't think you--	No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?	0
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.	0
And, what, I'm not serious?	You sound like my fucking probation officer.	0
I am planning to go out and do some work.	Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?	0
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.	0
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.	Can't.  Got plans of my own.	0
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...	WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?	0
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.	Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--	0
Will you take me back to my grandparents?	Of course.	0
Hi.	No trouble at all, really.	0
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.	No.	0
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.	Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.	0
Where am I?	She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.	0
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!	We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--	0
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.	Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....	0
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?	I'm gonna clean it up.	0
It's always in the more gifted of the three.	No... of course not.	0
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.	In Group?	0
It's crossed my mind from time to time.	No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??	0
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.	Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.	0
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.	Guess you missed it.	0
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.	Where are you at least?	0
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!	That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!	0
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!	But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.	0
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.	Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?	0
Thank God, Austin, we made it.	Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.	0
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?	0
Two hours.	What?	0
Doc...	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...	0
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.	It's only a machine.	0
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!	Why didn't you run after them?	0
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.	No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.	0
Be quiet and listen.	No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.	0
May I ask you a personal question?	...Yes.	0
Oh. That. Rome.	Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...	0
Mordechai?	Yes Esther.	0
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --	The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!	0
Mitch...	Wait here. Don't move.	0
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?	He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.	0
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.	0
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.	Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.	0
Yeah I guess...sort of.	But we wouldn't really be related right?	0
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.	Well, no system is.	0
I called you a taxi.	Very thoughtful.	0
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?	Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.	0
Ray wants him.	Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.	0
I don't fuckin' cook.	The stuff we got last night.	0
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.	A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?	0
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.	Yes - I suppose so...	0
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.	May I please be excused?	0
You heard him.  I'm a star!	Pretty slick, eh?	0
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.	If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.	0
Then why go back now?	Still trying to figure it out myself.	0
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?	Hal has it.	0
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.	0
Why would I do that?	What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.	0
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --	Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?	0
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.	He never told me...	0
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?	No.	0
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.	Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.	0
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.	Don't feel like nothing.	0
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.	-- Sure.	0
I've got to go --	Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.	0
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!	What? What am I supposed to sense?	0
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.	That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.	0
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.	Massachussettans aren't.	0
Yes, Uncle. How are you?	Smile.	0
I can still use a gun.	Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.	0
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!	Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.	0
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?	Somebody jammed the locks with gum.	0
In a lake.	Dogs?	0
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?	Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.	0
This conversation's over.	What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?	0
What?  What are you talking about?	Right on the flight line?	0
Teasing you is completely unfair.	You haven't finished your beer.	0
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?	Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.	0
You what?	You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.	0
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Especially with an election coming up in a few days.	0
Who are you?	What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.	0
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.	That so.	0
No.  What's my cut?	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?	0
What's his name?	I believe I can bring him back.	0
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?	Meet someone?	0
Huh?	What thing could we be in together?	0
Aren't you eating?	No.	0
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?	Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?	0
The what?	Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.	0
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.	I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.	0
I was scared.	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?	0
You promised me a drink....	Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....	0
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.	Well... I don't think that'd work.	0
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.	You know some interesting people.	0
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons	You talk them into it?	0
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.	Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.	0
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...	What the hell are you talking about?	0
Yeah.	George is going to open a shop.	0
The Head Man's writing a Bill.	A Bill! Not *him*!	0
He's not home.	So?	0
Run.	That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.	0
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.	Sounds intriguing.	0
I'm here.	I thought we'd lost you.	0
And it ruins everything else.	MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.	0
I don't want them to love me.	I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.	0
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.	Is this -- what?	0
Yeah. Why are you asking?	Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.	0
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.	Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?	0
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?	No, I guess not. I'm an actor.	0
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.	All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.	0
I don't know. Should you?	Wait a minute -	0
Promise me you will never leave me.	I cannot promise you that.	0
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.	Where's his father?	0
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.	You say some of the children died?	0
Would he know?	He knows. A lot.	0
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --	You what?	0
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.	Wait.	0
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.	Why not?	0
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?	No.	0
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.	He must've unsealed the room!	0
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?	Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.	0
Slow down a second, you met with Low --	You were right. He found me.	0
You told me to change my hair!	What?	0
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.	I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?	0
Where's Harry?	That's what we want to find out.	0
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --	Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.	0
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?	What are you talkin' a- ?	0
Take it easy, though.	No--I mean--yes--that is--	0
Yes.	Francesca?	0
They won't.	I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.	0
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.	Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --	0
Yeah, but I don't know --	Hello, Eve.	0
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.	Just introducing myself to the neighbors.	0
Pop Leibel.	I'll need something personal of theirs.	0
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.	I sure hope so.	0
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.	There's always a surprise.	0
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.	0
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.	So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.	0
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.	It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.	0
How did it happen?	Been meaning to talk to you about that.	0
What are you doing?	Oh. Nothing... Sitting.	0
I canít believe this...  Whatís coming now, eh? If I donít pay all Hellís gonna break loose, is that it?	Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?	0
Why selfish?	Were all these people questioned this afternoon?	0
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?	Ye-es, Je-an?	0
It hit me!  Where are they?!	I can't see them!	0
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...	Hey, how ya doin'?	0
You're wrong.	Bye.	0
Are you saying they won't help us?	I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.	0
I don't want to fight, George.	I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.	0
I'm reporting you to the IRS.	Can't.  Got plans of my own.	0
Anything you didn't understand?	Because ñ somehow ñ they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.	0
No.	Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.	0
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?	Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?	0
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.	Your husband is dead?	0
Anger. Rage. Frustration.	She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.	0
No, I don't think so.	I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.	0
He is...?	He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.	0
Think about your father. Your sister.	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.	0
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.	0
I still don't see why we're doing this.	We're supposed to be in school.	0
What're those?	Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.	0
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-	Good-night, folks.	0
I've got a hearing tomorrow --	He's a house-afire!	0
You want her to call you Jack?	From the air?	0
What about plan C?	Fuck plan C!	0
Dinner in ten minutes.	Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.	0
Through a window.	I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.	0
Put in a quarter.	It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.	0
Of course.	If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.	0
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.	Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!	0
Well, why don't you say it?	I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?	0
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.	Partly.  But partly, you're mad.	0
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?	Murdered man.	0
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.	You got in.	0
No... forget it...	When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.	0
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.	Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.	0
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.	Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.	0
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.	0
How?	I don't know for Christ's sake!	0
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.	Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.	0
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.	Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?	0
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.	Say the greeting again...	0
THEN WHAT?	Then you got undressed.	0
He must have.	I'm in love with you!	0
You okay?	Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.	0
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.	I need to talk to you about Will Graham.	0
Who was that?	I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.	0
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?	Sure -- I don't even feel it.	0
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.	You like me. How come?	0
Mommy please help me!	Ever think of moving there full time?	0
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.	Let's get a hot dog.	0
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?	Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.	0
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.	I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....	0
David --	Ellie.	0
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.	I guess.	0
Oh, you will?	No...I was hoping to get a kiss.	0
You're going to be late for your match.	You don't know Monsieur Philipe?	0
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.	-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.	0
No more chocolate chip cookies.	Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.	0
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.	0
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.	God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.	0
Why don't you start with me?	You're not them.	0
That's because I never had sex with him!	Ok. What's your name?	0
It tastes bad.	Do you want me to come over?	0
This is nice.	Never been here before?	0
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.	You like me, huh?	0
What you *have* to do is fight!	Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.	0
Benjamin -- what's happening?	Put the bat down, Wendy.	0
Yah - how are you doon?	Yeah. To watch the world go by.--	0
Nick, please, it's me --	Was he?	0
He might be ready to chop us up.	I don't think you do.	0
Um...	Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?	0
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.	And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.	0
I've never met him?	He's rich.	0
Oh.  That's nice.	Yeah.	0
What did you do with your dog?	Kurt's been feeding him.	0
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.	When was the last time you washed your hair?	0
Uh, oh. Now it's time.	Honey?	0
Not like He punished me.	You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.	0
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.	Yeah......yeah.....	0
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.	0
They must've bought the same map we did.	What do you say we send a bottle over?	0
No you didn't.  You took the car.	Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.	0
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.	I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...	0
I don't have a problem with it.	So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..	0
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.	It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?	0
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.	Just once.	0
Tell me why!	Like that?	0
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --	But I don't gamble, Hilda!	0
Will you bring up my purse before you go?	I have to go now. I'm sorry.	0
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?	The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.	0
Butch called.	Did he?	0
...Certain people are --	Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?	0
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?	No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.	0
No. This is a set up.	Let's do it.	0
Home.	Someone waiting for you?	0
And then --?	No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.	0
Why don't I believe you?	Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --	0
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.	Yeah.	0
Do you think I'm a fool?	What?	0
Do you think I took some of that money?	Because that's where I found it. I was there.	0
NO!!	But they did take place?	0
How is he -- ?	This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.	0
I think you have your answer.	War it is.	0
Well, those are the breaks.	Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.	0
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --	Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?	0
Norman, you have to look at this!	Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?	0
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?	0
I'm sure.	Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?	0
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.	And falling in love?	0
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.	Seemed, not was.	0
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?	It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.	0
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.	Oh, yeah?	0
You don't remember me.	No ... They won't be able to tell.	0
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?	Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.	0
I thought you said no more aches and pains?	On what.	0
Travis, you haven't even played the record?	See you next week.	0
Unwelcome.	I know a way.	0
All of it.	You and me.	0
No...	What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!	0
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.	I don't care about the rest of the world!	0
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.	Wow!	0
Attraction is a complication?	Guess people ought to know who I am...	0
You swear?	A man of some travels.	0
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...	That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!	0
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.	I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --	0
The hell you will, Harry York.	Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.	0
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.	I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	0
You almost got us killed!	If you only knew...	0
I have something to tell you.	Lay it on me.	0
If you want to look at it that way...	How would you look at it?	0
And what's the mysterious code word?	What?	0
Will you give this letter to Michael.	Of course I can. I have a note from mother.	0
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.	I fell in love last night -- the real thing.	0
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.	Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.	0
That was a compliment.	Will you go with me?	0
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.	It's impossible!	0
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.	0
That's my dad.	Really.  He has a cop's face.	0
Is this your new dress suit?	Yes, Swana.	0
You promised me flowers.	What?	0
No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?	0
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --	Erin, it's just a meeting.	0
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?	Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?	0
Don't you care?	There's very little I can do about it.	0
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?	Um, hi?	0
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--	That's true. What are you?	0
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?	Yeah, well, she started all that in London.	0
I know what ability you're interested in.	What do you say? Let's head for the lights.	0
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.	Can't you tell?	0
What's wrong?	I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.	0
Get well soon.	Every day in every way.	0
Then you've read it?	Not yet.	0
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.	What...?	0
Maybe that is his boat.	Do I know you?	0
Still mad at me?	For what.	0
I'm sorry.	Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.	0
Comb my hair out later, honey.	No, that's okay, I'll do It now.	0
Youíre mad...	Iíve had a long and unpleasant day. Iím tired and Iím angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leonís boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havenít you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?	0
... Good night, Chauncey.	What about all those ideas you had?	0
-- You remember.	Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.	0
You've been married twice --	I think it was a little more complicated than --	0
Go around him.	There's not enough room.	0
Just about anything, Walter.	Would you let me make...a statue of you?	0
I want to be alone.	Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.	0
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.	Hey!  There are crazy people here.	0
What do you want here?	Yes or no.	0
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.	Come on. You can't be serious.	0
Did someone say I wasn't nice?	Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.	0
wasóbutó	But what!	0
With pay!  She is out the door.	But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.	0
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?	Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.	0
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.	Maybe you will after you've thought it over.	0
You have to meet Bess.	Okay.	0
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.	What did all this stuff cost you?	0
Real genuine guy.	He's good at what he does.	0
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.	Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.	0
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...	It was... Fantastic.	0
P-whipped, p-whipped.	Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.	0
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.	I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.	0
What about the game?!	I'm not playing.	0
So, do you enjoy being an actor?	Oh sure. It's very rewarding...	0
Will that be cash or charge?	How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?	0
How do you think I'm doing?	I don't know what happened.	0
Is there anything else you want to know?	Where you were when your husband died.	0
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!	Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.	0
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.	I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.	0
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?	I vote for me.	0
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.	Hold on.	0
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?	We was crossin' the river--	0
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!	What? What could he do?	0
Mitch...	Shhh. Shhh.	0
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.	Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...	0
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..	I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.	0
Give us time.	I'm sorry honey. I got behind.	0
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.	Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.	0
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.	No. I am a "tubab."	0
It was wonderful.	That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.	0
You've got Dickie's rings.	SO!	0
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.	He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.	0
Oh yeah?	You work around town?	0
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.	Paden.	0
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.	No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?	0
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.	0
So -- how long will you be gone this time?	So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...	0
And?	The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.	0
What was the problem?	Hi.	0
That's because --	It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.	0
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.	That's right.	0
Do something.	...Stanley Moss...	0
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.	What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"	0
I don't think I'm going.	Why not?	0
Do we know anything about him?	Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.	0
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?	Upper West Side.	0
Then what is it?	They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.	0
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.	It's only that I really enjoy your company and...	0
What?	Stop playing me Sloan.	0
It's early yet.	I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--	0
Please--	He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.	0
That's so beautiful...	Yeah.	0
Why, yes. This is amazing.	If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.	0
What'd you say, Brother?	She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.	0
I suppose.	So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.	0
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.	Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...	0
What are we having?	It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.	0
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.	I never *asked* for any responsibility.	0
What are we going to do?	There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.	0
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.	Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.	0
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?	Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.	0
Jake!	Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.	0
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?	It's perfect.	0
Yeah.	Oh, I would love to hear it.	0
I better go check on them.	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?	0
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.	Oh, that Karl.	0
Mrs. Simmonds.	Yes.	0
Do you really think I should go to the commune?	Absolutely.	0
Don't go in.	You just move in here?	0
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?	So I shall avenge my master's death after all.	0
Consider it your musical education.	I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.	0
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.	Then why do you?	0
You see ghosts, Cole?	Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?	0
I'm here, Harry.	Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.	0
That's something I suppose.	All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.	0
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.	Then I'll go with you.	0
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?	Yeah, I'd believe it.	0
The leaves...	Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.	0
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.	I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.	0
I beg your pardon!	Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to youó  scram.	0
Rub it on the windows!	What-	0
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.	How can you do it to yourself?	0
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.	0
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.	No, you look good. I was just wondering.	0
On what?	The priest.	0
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...	Ninotchka, you're jealous.	0
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.	I don't know.	0
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?	Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.	0
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?	You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!	0
That stupid hillbilly slut.	Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.	0
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.	Hi. Pat Bateman.	0
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...	Just wanted to put him on edge...	0
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.	M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-	0
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?	Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.	0
But it's not, Jimmy.	I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.	0
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.	Oh, damnit!	0
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...	0
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.	Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.	0
"Be there?"	Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.	0
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...	Who cares ?	0
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!	He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.	0
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --	A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --	0
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.	Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.	0
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?	Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.	0
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.	0
...and my lover. He was Harry.	Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.	0
He's already there.	Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.	0
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.	Does he know that?	0
But what if...	Count to twenty.  Iíll be there.	0
Of course I do. What do you meanó	Beat it!	0
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.	No, we're not!	0
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.	What are you talking about?	0
Where are you going?!	The reactor.	0
You don't understand shit.	He may have a gun!	0
You alright?	STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...	0
What do you mean?	Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.	0
Must be a spare set.	I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.	0
That was just so... awful!	No, this is serious. Say it backwards.	0
A book on the warehouse murders?	Guess "please" would be a stretch.	0
Will you bring it in to me?	I'd rather not.	0
Come on Theo, what about plan C?	What's plan C?	0
Wolfi! Your father is dead.	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.	0
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!	Where's that?	0
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.	No. Josie, this is real.	0
My pimp.	You have a pimp?	0
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.	What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?	0
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -	Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.	0
Not too quickly.	What?	0
That doesn't look like very much clay.	Oh it's enough...	0
I know. I know. He didn't go.	You mean --	0
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.	It hurts.	0
More the merrier.	No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.	0
You mean it?	Mm. And your like, what else?	0
Reed. How close are we to a cure?	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.	0
Zander is going for pilot, too.	You two have so much in common.	0
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?	I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.	0
Yes--are you?	I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.	0
So you can give me more shit?	M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?	0
Who is it?	I killed them.	0
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.	It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.	0
You mean like you loved Mom?	...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?	0
Thanks for the backup.	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.	0
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -	Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.	0
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.	In aid of what?	0
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.	My meat and two veg.	0
I beg your pardon.	No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.	0
You say 'fuck' a lot.	No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.	0
Oh God.	Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.	0
The staff donít know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnít take any more...	What?	0
I want to be a teacher.	Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.	0
It's so nice.	I don't know.	0
What are you doing here?	I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.	0
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.	What is this?	0
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.	What's that?	0
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.	It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...	0
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.	Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.	0
Don't.	Don't look?	0
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -	Bye.	0
I have my own little island.	But it gets cold in winter....	0
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?	Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.	0
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.	"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."	0
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.	No, no-no-no, I'm sure.	0
It's pretty old.	Not here... alone.  May we? Please?	0
Oh. I see.	...I had a dream about...something like that.	0
You got the Extender?	No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.	0
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.	What the fuck is going on?	0
Not directly anyhow ...	It's fine.	0
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.	No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.	0
What's that got to do with it?	But what?	0
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.	Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.	0
Hm.  We should do it again.	Just every once in a blue moon, you know.	0
That.	You?	0
He'll kill you.	You're not hearing me here --	0
Uh ...	In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.	0
So, how's it going today?	All about me...	0
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?	Excuse me?	0
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.	Me neither.	0
Oh shit.	Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?	0
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.	Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?	0
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.	Yeah, but what about--	0
Look at you... You want to go.	Where?	0
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.	Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.	0
Stella.	Paden.	0
What are you going to do?	I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.	0
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.	When?	0
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.	Why?	0
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.	Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.	0
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?	He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...	0
Mr. Van Orton... ?	Ilsa... you're alright?	0
Working.	Do you ever see him?	0
Can you say it?	Huh?	0
What's the matter?	What is it?	0
Is this the Community Hospital?	God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....	0
Can't you have a normal conversation?	Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?	0
What happened to your eye?	Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?	0
A game?	It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.	0
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?	I do.	0
Can I have my desk please.	Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?	0
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.	I like it well done.	0
He knew my husband who died.	How'd he die?	0
I loved it blond.	The Telegraph office.	0
Don't talk to me like that.	Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.	0
Why did you take the money?	He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.	0
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.	The Dome--the Capitol Dome--	0
I recall you.	I was walking past and I saw you in here...	0
I-you know, I don't wanna.	What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.	0
Are you supposed to be here?	So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?	0
So?	Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.	0
No, Nick, please --	My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.	0
What do you know about classical music?	Nothing.. Selling is selling.	0
I don't know the steps.	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!	0
I want him to at least see the sky!	--and we will--	0
It's an uprising.	And I intend to be there when she's ready.	0
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.	You don't like her at all do you?	0
That "thing" gets me excited.	The things that get you excited.	0
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!	But, Lily--	0
Not yet.  But we'll find him.	Don't DO that!!	0
And that's a bad thing?	Figure you would have tried it already.	0
He's home. I sent the signal.	What's wrong?	0
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.	No.	0
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.	You was friends.	0
Were any of them married?	What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.	0
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.	Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.	0
Oh, God...	Why?	0
Okay.	What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?	0
Do you have a phone?	I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?	0
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!	Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.	0
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.	Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.	0
What did ya do?	And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.	0
Change what?	I need to go.	0
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...	Some miss all their shots.	0
Noooo!	Jesus Christ lady...	0
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.	I am a very good gardener.	0
It'll ruin everything.	I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.	0
What's the matter with you?	What right do you have to take me for granted?	0
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...	Mother, where did you go to law school?	0
...Hello...?	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.	0
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.	0
Take it.	Agatha...	0
Yeah, but.	Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?	0
You don't believe that.	Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?	0
You're frightened.	No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.	0
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.	Barry Egan.	0
What are you doing here?	I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.	0
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.	But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.	0
So we'll meet him, then?	What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'	0
There's nothing to say.	Well, that'll be the first time.	0
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?	Where'd you get that dress?	0
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.	I can't till the hatch is flooded!	0
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-	Your make-up's a little heavy.	0
Goodbye, Bobby.	Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.	0
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.	I don't know.	0
I...	What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?	0
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?	Johana, am I boring you?	0
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?	No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.	0
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.	Keep climbing.  I will follow...	0
Shut up, Diz.	All right, well, good night.	0
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.	A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?	0
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?	Oh, yuh did, huh?	0
Say, all wars have innocent victims.	Well, all wars do -	0
Why?	Recommended?	0
What's that?	My glands.  They grow old too fast.	0
What other people?	I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.	0
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.	Ok, whatever you want.	0
You want... a free one.	I'm a what?	0
Then what are we going to do?	Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.	0
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?	Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!	0
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?	Where you married?	0
Take it back. Till you sell your book.	Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.	0
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.	When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?	0
Terrible, thank you.	You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.	0
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.	It's all right for a bachelor.	0
Forget her.	It would matter to us.	0
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.	This is a totally barbaric custom.	0
The General threatened me.	Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble óó the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.	0
Where are you going?	I'm taking a shower.	0
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.	Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.	0
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.	I do not.	0
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?	Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.	0
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?	No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.	0
If I eat it I'll throw up.	No.	0
Mulder -- what are you doing?	Do I know you?	0
What are you doing?	I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --	0
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!	It's not quite the same thing.	0
Why?	Charlie -	0
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.	So you're gonna act salty all night?	0
But ... you did it before!  Last time --	Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.	0
She had white shoes.	I think I'll go see Debi today.	0
I could stay here forever...	I donít think Iíd fight you on that one...	0
On paper?	I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.	0
Why 're you doing this?	There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?	0
You were very different yesterday.	Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.	0
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.	C'mon --	0
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.	Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.	0
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.	So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.	0
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.	That's all we need.	0
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?	I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.	0
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.	That's all right. He don't mind.	0
You all right?	Sure...	0
We did it.	Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.	0
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.	Oh, as long as we're here...	0
About what?	It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.	0
Are you okay?	Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.	0
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.	0
So you were cheated.	No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.	0
That's lucky.	You do?	0
Are you really a bail bondsman?	And I you.	0
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.	Oh Marge.	0
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.	337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.	0
Maybe we should just leave --	I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.	0
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...	You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?	0
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.	That's impossible.	0
Can't you give it to me later?	Mine, too.	0
How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.	0
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?	Yes, Swana.	0
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.	Well... we're glad to have you.	0
C'mon, are you or aren't you?	A check?	0
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...	Oh Sidney...	0
How about Cinderellaóor a real hot love story?	Yeah. But enough about me.	0
What d'you mean?	And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.	0
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...	Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.	0
So, this could be your last night, huh?	Emily, you -	0
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.	What were you doing in a library?	0
So, do you like me, Seymour?	You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?	0
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.	Was he morose, or...?  I mean...	0
God.  You're a real live outlaw!	What happened to the walk and the nakedness?	0
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.	I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.	0
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.	0
Frank would open you.	Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.	0
Yeah?	If you'll just maybe ease it into second.	0
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?	I don't know, I think he's funny.	0
Could I speak to you in private?	Guess "please" would be a stretch.	0
The kid. Junior.	Gone.	0
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...	What makes him so special?	0
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!	No.	0
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.	They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.	0
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.	And you believe that?	0
Hey, you said you did a video?	We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.	0
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?	"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?	0
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.	No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.	0
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.	If you hadn't used profanity --	0
We talked.	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...	0
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.	Oh, really?	0
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?	Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.	0
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.	It's nice.	0
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.	...and your General?	0
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.	Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.	0
And I really don't know your noises yet.	Well, when you wonder, ask me.	0
No, you didn't say that, Brother.	Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.	0
I didnít know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Iíve known for five years. Heís known Iíve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnít speak about...	One just doesnít... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?	0
Oh -- Oh, come on.	It's possible.	0
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.	All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?	0
Things can't get much worse can they?	No, I'm ok.	0
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.	Am I a thing?	0
Are you serious.	Who?	0
You going to wait here for me?	It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.	0
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.	S'okay.  I know you still love me.	0
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.	You must have been a baby.	0
Daniel.  Listen --	Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.	0
You're going too?	He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.	0
Oh, come on, come on!	Jump in.	0
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?	This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!	0
After that, who cares?	They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.	0
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.	Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.	0
You know I can't do that.	I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.	0
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.	Yeah - Josephine.	0
That's too bad.	It's nice.	0
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.	I'm getting better all the time.	0
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.	No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.	0
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?	What happened?	0
Victor!	Do you know why I'm here?	0
How important do you think sex is?	Not very.	0
Are you sure?	You don't believe me, see for yourself.	0
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.	0
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --	I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.	0
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?	0
Dolores.	Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.	0
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!	Oh, who cares?	0
What, are you trying to handicap me?	You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.	0
Hello?	Definitely off.	0
You can see her?	Yes.	0
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.	'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...	0
Where are you staying while you're here?	I'm sorry I took you in there.	0
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.	How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!	0
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.	No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.	0
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.	0
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.	Who's doing this?	0
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?	I will, don't worry.	0
Which one is me? The horse?	Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...	0
Scottie!	How does it work?	0
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.	It is kind of rough.	0
Let go of my arm...	Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!	0
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...	What sort of thing?	0
Where should I hide the car keys?	'Mean the whispers?	0
Alright?	Not all that pasta.	0
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.	Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.	0
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.	But what?	0
YOU'RE A LIAR!	Look at me.	0
But you threw a knife at my head!	And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.	0
Cheery looking bunch.	Better living through electricity.	0
No-o-o!	I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!	0
Get out!	Now just get off the train.	0
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.	I have to qualify, is that it?	0
I just wish you could have heard her.	What'd you say?	0
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.	What about tonight?	0
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.	The ferret?	0
You talk to the married couple?	Not yet.	0
Who?	Good girrrl!	0
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.	You forgot "sexy".	0
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.	It couldn't!	0
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...	Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?	0
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.	Go where?	0
Yes, you do.	False alarm.	0
Jack...	Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.	0
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!	Did I scare you?	0
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.	That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.	0
No, no, of course not.	...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...	0
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!	You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!	0
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.	As do I.	0
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.	0
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...	0
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?	He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?	0
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.	Still wants to move out?	0
I suppose they told you that...?	The hell they did.	0
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --	Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.	0
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.	And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.	0
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.	His name?	0
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.	It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.	0
Your folks live there?	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.	0
There isn't any more to tell.	Don't say that.	0
Where is he?	He's right here in the...	0
It will?	Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.	0
How was your day?	Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.	0
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?	No, thank you.  Goodnight.	0
Santos...	Explain it... I told you.	0
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.	That's good. I like to watch, too.	0
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...	I don't think so.	0
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."	What'd he say?	0
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.	That's what <u>you</u> think...	0
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?	I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.	0
It's easier to lure sharks at night.	So you're gonna act salty all night?	0
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.	Watch? --	0
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.	How childish are you going to get before you quit it?	0
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.	No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.	0
When did you two talk this over?	We haven't.	0
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?	What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.	0
Not a specific day. What's this about?	Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?	0
What is this place?	This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?	0
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.	But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.	0
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?	Nothing.	0
I bet you have a great family.	You know, nothing special.	0
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.	Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.	0
Where are you taking me?	Just some sketches.	0
Here, you want some?	Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.	0
Yes?	Something happens to my confidence.	0
Would you like me to seduce you?	Talk to you tomorrow.	0
Are you wearing a uniform?	No.	0
Are you arresting me?	If that's the way you want to play it.	0
Come on!!	All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?	0
Why would she come here...	This is where I proposed.	0
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...	It's not important good night.	0
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.	Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.	0
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.	Well there....  What's the difference?	0
Professor, what's the history of this house?	I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.	0
Typically male point of view.	Well, yeah, but --	0
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.	Fast work. You just moved here.	0
Nothing.	I'm cooking you dinner.	0
Can't you have a normal conversation?	I don't want to have any conversation.	0
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.	0
Sit down!	No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.	0
I didn't mean to get personal.	Yes you did.	0
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?	Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.	0
Dewey, you and I would never make it.	Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -ó	0
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.	I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.	0
Leave your sister out of it.	You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.	0
Yeah.	And here, you just-	0
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?	No. I take it you don't either?  How long?	0
There's two of 'em, Lou!	Yah?	0
I want to know everything about you.	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.	0
I'll take Cathy up to bed.	Are you staying?	0
Do I not please you, Jack?	Just once.	0
Which could maybe what?	Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --	0
You're okay, though, huh?	I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?	0
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.	0
You worship yourself.	Thank you.	0
Oh my God. Tom.	Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?	0
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?	Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.	0
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.	I dunno, I...	0
Oh.	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.	0
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.	I do.	0
You're not much with girls, are you?	Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.	0
That's not what you came to say.	Oh no. In the car you did it?	0
I can't open it.	It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.	0
Paper or cloth?	I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!	0
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....	This is a totally barbaric custom.	0
I don't care! We'd be together.	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.	0
You're begging him to kill you?	If he thinks he's man enough.	0
How come?	That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.	0
She fell down.	No.  Stick around.	0
I just stopped in to say hi.	Yeah, well... hi...	0
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.	Can I help?	0
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.	Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.	0
-- the window and door grates --	-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --	0
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!	Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.	0
Where did it come from?	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.	0
This is the second opinion.	Well, then a third opinion.	0
Did you hear me?	Yeah.	0
Expect so.	Yes.	0
Don't spend all day down there.	Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?	0
Everyhing go off all right?	You took the time to pay the saleswoman.	0
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.	That's great.	0
They put you in charge?	We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.	0
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.	I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.	0
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?	I believe I said I'd be tempted.	0
No, not really. Middle-class.	Oh, me too. Middle-class.	0
Yes.	I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.	0
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?	What?	0
You want some berries?	Hunh?	0
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.	I'll be glad to avoid the crush.	0
And he's a perfect stranger to me.	And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.	0
Oh, is that it!	What did you find?	0
Do you want to sleep on it?	I know, it's stupid.	0
Got it!	Got what?	0
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.	Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.	0
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.	Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.	0
... Who are you?	Who do you think I am?	0
Let me go home.	No.	0
Like how?	Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.	0
That's entrapment.	No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.	0
Thank you.	Detroit.	0
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.	I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.	0
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.	This is my way of telling you --	0
Michelle.	Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?	0
Yes, Mikey?	Do you have any brothers or sisters?	0
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.	Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?	0
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.	Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.	0
Are you sure this line is clean?	It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?	0
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.	Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.	0
What?	It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.	0
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.	You're part of this, aren't you?!	0
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?	I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.	0
I just can't stand this.	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.	0
I know. Put Scott through college.	I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.	0
Come up to Boston with me?	Do I know you?	0
I'm sorry, sir.	When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.	0
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.	Do you miss it?	0
Oh, George, George!	Ok.	0
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.	A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.	0
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...	0
Yes. Like the quiche.	I like quiche.	0
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...	Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?	0
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.	You know you almost got us both Killed back there?	0
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.	That's the kid.	0
Hello.	I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.	0
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?	Does he love you?	0
Oh, yeah?	He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.	0
Don't you think you should at least wave?	Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?	0
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...	You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?	0
What?	I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.	0
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.	0
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.	There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...	0
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.	That must have made you proud.	0
And you want to use me to get him?	We'd better go outside. Quickly.	0
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?	Don't talk about Elaine?	0
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.	So you didn't go to school together.	0
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.	"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"	0
Are you sure?	I'm sure.  He's dead.	0
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.	That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.	0
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!	Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.	0
You're very funny --	Yes? -- Tomorrow?	0
Lie down!	Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?	0
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.	I'll manage.	0
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.	I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.	0
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?	Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.	0
They're starlings.	Is that right?	0
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?	I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.	0
You're sure about this?	...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...	0
Me?	Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.	0
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.	0
Italian?	I'm sorry.	0
Giron...!	Last night? What do you mean?	0
Yeah.	Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.	0
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.	They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.	0
It's not just inner beauty, is it?	Turn around.	0
Are you coming to confess?	She didn't like me.	0
It's so beautiful ... and sad.	Sad?	0
Oh shit.	All bands.	0
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	No pain, no gain?	0
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.	No.	0
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.	0
Otho'll know what to do.	Thank you.	0
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.	Tina, I'll be right back.	0
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.	I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.	0
What's that?	You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.	0
Ray?... What time is it?	Fine.	0
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."	Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.	0
You scared me.	I didn't aim to.	0
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.	That's my job too.	0
Jack.	He's a house-afire!	0
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.	Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?	0
Would you find me...?	Of course.	0
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?	Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?	0
Then you should not have sought an explanation.	It's too dangerous for--	0
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.	Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.	0
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?	I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.	0
Happy days.	You people...rich people...	0
No, he isn't.	Yah.	0
A future. The only future I've got.	That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...	0
Joe --	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.	0
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...	EXACTLY!	0
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?	You did?	0
Ted Sheldon.	Yeah, that's the one.	0
Go to the bathroom.	Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!	0
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience	Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?	0
Did you need something?	No, I'm too hot now.	0
Have you known her long?	Must've been after we got engaged.	0
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.	Were you a disco girl?	0
You should go back and rest.	No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?	0
It got that close.	Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.	0
Can I be honest?	Uh-huh.	0
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.	0
I'm hungry.	Call room service.	0
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.	Never mind my ears! Go away!	0
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.	Am I interrupting anything?	0
Hello, Sam.	Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.	0
You didn't tell me.	What about the cat?	0
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --	But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --	0
What was that all about?	You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.	0
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.	Then you would have gotten your money?	0
You can't do this to me!	Of course I can. I love you.	0
So it was "love".	Yeah.  It was.	0
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.	Where ya headed?	0
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.	0
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?	Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....	0
What if it isn't over?	Maybe you should tell me your dream.	0
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --	0
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?	Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?	0
Why?	I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.	0
We're almost married.	We're not married <u>yet</u>.	0
Is it?	I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.	0
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.	I think we should go.	0
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.	He requested this?	0
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...	And you said yes?	0
Hi, Ted.	That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.	0
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.	He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?	0
The day you got me out of jail?	What'd he say?	0
I think you must have had a love affair with her...	No, no! Just with her hands.	0
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?	Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.	0
What is it, Norman?	Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?	0
What shall we do?	Be patient.	0
What did he sound like on the phone?	You mean like going to the pictures?	0
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.	At least you walked.	0
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!	Could I ask some questions?	0
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.	0
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...	It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?	0
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --	He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?	0
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!	Nothing to tell.	0
I like the colors.	And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.	0
I like you very much, Walter.	I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!	0
Miller, do you read me, Peters --	Get them back --	0
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--	Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...	0
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...	Sorry to disappoint you...	0
Stu?	Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!	0
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.	I don't know, but I sure hope so.	0
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.	The hell we can't.	0
I hear things in this house,	I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.	0
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.	As long as I get the laugh.	0
So you've done it --	Well I don't go out very much.	0
Mickey?	I just can't look at you the same way.	0
Not much further.	Transference.	0
Where're you going?	I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.	0
Fuck off.	I should leave. You probably need your rest.	0
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.	That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?	0
I feel better. Do you?	That's good.	0
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?	Yes.	0
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.	Why?	0
Thank you.	Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...	0
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?	What's that?	0
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...	She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.	0
What would he be doing down there?	I don't know.	0
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.	Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...	0
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.	That's what you theenk.	0
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?	Undressed like this, yes.	0
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.	Was I?	0
The system would collapse.	I believe in that system...	0
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.	Nothing wrong with trying.	0
Tomorrow night? Well --	Tomorrow morning.	0
What -- am I --	Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.	0
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.	Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?	0
Aren't we early?	Little celebration before we set off.	0
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?	Because...  I was already dead.	0
No.	It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!	0
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.	A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.	0
I have a tiny apartment.	Yeah, I know it's small.	0
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.	I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--	0
You will?	Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!	0
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...	Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.	0
It sounds like you were banished.	Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?	0
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...	OK. I'll stop talking then.	0
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.	When you didn't come to the club.	0
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.	Um, yeah sure, I guess.	0
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --	What is it, Rose?	0
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.	Huh?	0
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.	I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.	0
What?	Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.	0
They're not just our business managers, Panes.	I... I don't get along with people like that.	0
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!	That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.	0
Yes.	...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.	0
He hates my fuckin' guts.	Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.	0
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.	Uh... good.	0
Dysfunctional --	That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --	0
Filiba ...	Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--	0
Terry, no, no... .	That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	0
Oh, God.	I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?	0
Peter Warne? I don't like it.	Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.	0
I realize that...	Hi, honey.	0
Just your age.	Which is what?	0
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?	Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.	0
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.	You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?	0
My guess is dead.	Good d--	0
Kiss me.	It'll do fine.	0
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?	Precisely.	0
Well, sure, we can leave it up.	I want someone I know to take me in.	0
I hope you're comfortable.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?	0
No dogs, huh? Okay.	And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.	0
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?	0
So you fucked a student?!	That's not what I'm sayi--	0
I don't believe so.	Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.	0
No, I mean --	-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.	0
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.	I'm glad you like it.	0
Then you *did* say it.	Gordon Liddy, you mean?	0
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.	What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?	0
Hamlet. Have you read it?	No.	0
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.	I ain't drunk, honey.	0
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?	It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.	0
Oh my God.	-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --	0
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...	This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!	0
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.	I think someone's watching.	0
Now, what did I do to deserve this?	Pull over.	0
They did?	A lady. She died.	0
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.	Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.	0
Oh, Mr Crane--	Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?	0
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.	Arenít you curious to know about Friedman?	0
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!	I put in for a replacement for you but no one...	0
You never spoke so well of him.	He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.	0
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.	Of course.	0
In Detroit. This weekend.	Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.	0
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...	Carlos De Moraes?	0
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!	Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?	0
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?	Yes, I reckon that's it.	0
Take your time, Jer.	Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.	0
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.	I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?	0
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?	Lily, you must listen to me.	0
What assholes.	Hmmm.	0
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.	Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.	0
How do I fight it?	Yes.	0
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.	The extrovert.	0
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.	Hey, Grant.	0
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --	Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.	0
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.	Frances, You're crazy.	0
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.	It takes even less.	0
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?	You mean...and orgasm?	0
What did they say?	Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.	0
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?	I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....	0
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...	0
I almost didn't.	I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.	0
Is that you?	It's me.	0
Keep going.	Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.	0
I don't know the finish yet.	Nobody's that unhappy.	0
Just for fun?	She's adorable. But I had to end it.	0
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.	It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...	0
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.	Not.	0
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.	Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?	0
Merry Christmas, Jack.	Merry Christmas.	0
They're dead?	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.	0
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?	Yeah.	0
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...	To kill me.	0
Hey, he's not sore, is he?	Then I know my alphabet.	0
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.	Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.	0
Answer my question!	Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.	0
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?	No.	0
I feel really stupid.	Really?	0
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?	That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.	0
Alla puttanesca.	Automobile ignitions are insulated.	0
I'm okay.	Good.  He's up next.	0
Did you buy that gun?	Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.	0
Was nice.	Yes.	0
Huh?	Late one night. About three. At the plaza.	0
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.	Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.	0
What do you mean?	I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.	0
There's little chicks!  You want to see?	Sure.	0
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.	You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.	0
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --	Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.	0
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.	Well...	0
There was a recipe on the back  --	Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.	0
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.	Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!	0
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...	Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Iíd sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...	0
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...	Yes. I would like to do that.	0
You don't love me.	Stop.	0
Yes, I know.	Come on inna dining room.	0
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?	What??	0
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.	He wants to show now.	0
Somewhere else, that's for sure.	I just came back from Phoenix.	0
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.	Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.	0
Is she all right?	How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?	0
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.	...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.	0
Really.  What are you writing about.	A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.	0
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.	Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...	0
You play an instrument?	No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?	0
How did it happen?	We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughówe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]	0
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.	You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.	0
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.	Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...	0
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.	Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?	0
Do we know anything about him?	Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.	0
He's coming right over.	Coming here?	0
Pete... Don't...	Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...	0
So. Where are we sitting?	Come on.	0
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!	Makes sense - he's a spokesman.	0
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.	But who will they turn to for help?	0
So what gems do you have in your collection?	Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.	0
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.	Hip alternative types who will understand the process betterÖ	0
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.	For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.	0
I think I'd better go home now please.	But, Elaine --	0
Then who did?	Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.	0
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.	A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.	0
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?	I can't resist.	0
They left.	What about friends?	0
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.	Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.	0
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.	Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --	0
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.	You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.	0
I love you.	I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.	0
Thank you.	-- do you want ice?	0
What have you been doing?	The Cretaceous.	0
Talk? To you? After what you did!	Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.	0
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?	Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.	0
You weren't dreaming about me.	Yeah. Call him.	0
Of course.	I miss it too.	0
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.	0
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.	Mock, mock, mock.	0
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.	Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?	0
So do I.  But for different reasons.	Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?	0
For musicals?  That's part of the job!	We need to talk.	0
Yes.	Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.	0
It means I got the money.	That's it? That's what you're giving me?	0
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.	I understand.	0
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?	Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.	0
What's the difference?	An artist of your caliber...	0
I've got patients coming in --	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?	0
I don't need the money.	This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.	0
Do you want breakfast?	... Looks like a convention.	0
Don't you remember?	Yes --	0
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--	Who paid the bill?	0
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...	What about the rest of my comic books?	0
You could have infected him, isn't that right?	Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.	0
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.	I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.	0
I don't.	This one has a special meaning.	0
Which way?	Three-cent stamp.	0
I don't know.  It's so much money...	Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.	0
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.	Don't even try to remember.	0
Excuse me?	A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.	0
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.	How'd you get this number?	0
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Oh.	0
Dylan, where's the man?	Babe Brother is a poor boy.	0
Yes.	Their power. They seduce me.	0
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...	Relax. I know what you meant.	0
Always the lawyer.	How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?	0
But...	Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.	0
You're not dumb.	I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.	0
He is an impostor.  Thereís no Davidov at Miratom.	Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?	0
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?	I don't know, I never met your father.	0
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.	0
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.	You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.	0
What kind of lead?	A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.	0
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.	Fine.	0
What were you thinking coming here?	I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.	0
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.	What did he say, exactly?	0
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?	I couldn't bear for it to end.	0
A night on the town instead of under it?	Don't cry.	0
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.	You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.	0
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?	Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...	0
I've heard some foolish things in my life.	God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?	0
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.	0
Where... can I stay?	First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.	0
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.	Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?	0
Alla puttanesca.	One more time.	0
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.	Oh, that's nice.	0
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?	He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.	0
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.	Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.	0
No, I didn't.	Voices from an old dark house!	0
I don't make small talk --	No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?	0
What's the problem?	You think I have a problem?	0
Their wedding clothes.	I'm just looking.	0
Really.	May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!	0
How d'you mean?	Well, I don't get on so well most places.	0
What's wrong now?	-- what?	0
Try sitting down.	Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.	0
Um... that's very relaxing.	No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.	0
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.	I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.	0
You matter to me.  Completely.	It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!	0
Enjoying your reading?	What kind of an act is this?	0
You're looking good, Auggie.	No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?	0
I thought you said you'd show me your place.	Not tonight.	0
What about you?	What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?	0
Not like that. Not like you say.	What do I tell your mother?	0
Is that your car?	It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --	0
Big spender.	From one professional to another, of course.	0
Never heard of him.	Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.	0
What?	Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!	0
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.	Margo, let's make peace.	0
No.	That sounds like a curse to me.	0
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-	Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.	0
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?	What'd he say?	0
Would you?	Would I?!! Why I oughta...	0
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.	The other reason?	0
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?	She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?	0
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.	Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.	0
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.	0
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...	Yeah.	0
No.	Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!	0
Make love?	Have sex. Y'know --	0
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.	Really?  What did White say?	0
I'm listening.	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.	0
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.	Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?	0
Who are you people?	My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --	0
That's where it gets a little strange.	And what about the guy that was following me?	0
What is it?  What's the matter?	I'm sure.	0
A girl with a body like mine?	For real.  I should be alone, anyway.	0
Ah.	I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!	0
Antihistamine.  For bites.	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?	0
What's he doing?	You were great. Thanks alot.	0
Not even a stalemate?	No.	0
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.	Small talk.  Try the weather.	0
Yeah.	Now what's he know about garbage, huh?	0
And I know that's not where you want to be.	... shit.	0
Do you want to-	More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?	0
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.	Hey-yo.	0
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.	0
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.	Yes.	0
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.	I'm taking a shower.	0
Train. It took eight hours.	I can't believe you're here.	0
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?	I told you, I love other people.	0
Yeah?	The serial killer?	0
You couldn't get these shutters open?	Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.	0
Why? What have you been thinking about?	Well -- I don't know.	0
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...	Yes.	0
Really?	It's Cosmo's moon.	0
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.	Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?	0
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!	The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -	0
Never mind. Where've you been?	A business meeting, I told you that.	0
Fifty degrees below and still falling.	And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.	0
Her name's Hannah.	Aye, ma'am.	0
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.	And many meatballs.	0
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.	Yeah.	0
Shit. You better tell me something.	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.	0
That's also none of your business.	Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.	0
I couldn't have... much longer.	Yeah... I know.	0
It's not. I can't take it.	Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.	0
I'm fine.	You look wonderful.	0
Not at all.	-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.	0
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.	I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.	0
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.	No. No. It's too good a story.	0
You're here.	OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?	0
What is it?	Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --	0
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?	She is not your birth mother, is she?	0
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...	Helen, I want you to be my wife.	0
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --	I know how DNA works, Erin --	0
What?	Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?	0
I really like you too...	...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?	0
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...	And I don't believe you...	0
My suitor?	The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.	0
To quarter-horses.	No. To thoroughbreds.	0
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.	I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?	0
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--	Now, wait a second --	0
Shall we go away for a couple of days?	Yeah... I'd like that.	0
What are you doing here?	You sleep in THAT?	0
We can do it...	Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.	0
Oh my God...  You're blushing.	And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.	0
HARRY? Are you okay?	You're welcome...??	0
Should I?	We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But itís never that complicated really.	0
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	What are they like? What are they about?	0
Kinda like men.	Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.	0
Who's Miss Johnson?	Yes, but you, you do care about me.	0
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.	I would have done the same thing.	0
Please -- just let me sleep.	One baked -- one fries.	0
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.	It's in your closet.	0
How are we gonna do this, Nick?	You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?	0
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnÌt prelude a meeting in private.	I don't believe you.	0
Like heroin?	I am.  Good day.  Madam.	0
It's not something I wanted either.	But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.	0
Take it.	More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?	0
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?	Come on, let's ride.	0
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?	No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.	0
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.	Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.	0
Yeah, like the bird.	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.	0
Thank you.	Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.	0
New ground?	Mm-hm.	0
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.	You can.	0
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.	No, not at all.	0
You're welcome.  Did you know him?	Eh, no.	0
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?	Yes!	0
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.	I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!	0
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.	You never know.  Lightning could strike.	0
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.	Go where?	0
Michael you're trying to scare me...	Then the thighs where they joined the torso.	0
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?	I'm glad you do.	0
Great.  Another deadbeat.	Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!	0
I thought we were helping.	They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.	0
Oh yeah?	Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?	0
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...	No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.	0
Don't puss out.	I won't.	0
Hello, Peter.	So where are you?	0
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?	Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.	0
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.	That's right.	0
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.	Looking for Maggie.	0
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?	If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.	0
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?	Sure.	0
Jill's coming with us.	Out!  Out!	0
They sure liked them devilled eggs.	You drink whiskey?	0
Francis? Where are you?	The developing room.  I need to... see you.	0
So?  Is that what you said to her?	No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"	0
Hey, Tim.	No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.	0
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.	I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?	0
It's boring, isn't it?	-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.	0
Can't you give it to me later?	Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.	0
I might do it wrong.	Not possible.	0
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?	A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.	0
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.	No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.	0
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?	You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?	0
I'd rather be with you.	That's nice.	0
What happened?	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?	0
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?	Figure you would have tried it already.	0
You okay?	Not long.	0
I found a room.	What did you say?	0
I couldn't tell you.	Why are there two deeds here?	0
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.	That's because he misses you.	0
Whatcha' doin'?	xxxxxx	0
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?	He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!	0
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?	I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!	0
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.	Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.	0
Any good?	I think you'll approve.	0
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-	Huh?  He's fucking loaded.	0
That's because I never had sex with him!	You sucked his dick!	0
So, what causes this?	Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.	0
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.	It's Iggy Pop.	0
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.	I just want to be a superhero.	0
Congratulations.	Same to you.	0
Dick-weed!	Butt-munch.	0
Zaltar. Use the wand!	Can I help you, sir?	0
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.	Is he coming here?	0
No. You?	What's it so hot in here for?	0
Now many?	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.	0
Leave him alone.	He can't stay up there.	0
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?	But John was with him at the pool?	0
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?	I'll tell you everything later.	0
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.	Do as I say. I will be there soon.	0
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.	0
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?	You can't imagine.	0
You'd never understand.	You mean Rashid?	0
I just asked a simple question.	And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...	0
Step number two.	Well...yeah--	0
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.	0
Three minutes, thirty seconds.	Distance from Reliant...	0
No you're not.	What?	0
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.	Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.	0
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.	We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.	0
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.	No fair guessing.	0
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?	0
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.	What?	0
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.	You've nothing to apologize for.	0
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.	It's under...	0
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!	I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.	0
What night?	When you didn't come to the club.	0
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.	...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.	0
No, I'm not.	In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?	0
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!	That idiot!	0
Look, that shit ain't mine.	It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?	0
I don't know the finish yet.	Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.	0
Well...	I'm twenty-eight	0
What are you going to do?	Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.	0
How can you say that, Sailor?	What makes sense, is all.	0
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?	Mm?	0
It was just great!	Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-	0
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?	Well there....  What's the difference?	0
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.	I don't know.	0
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.	It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.	0
Why'd call me a killer?	Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.	0
Whatever, you come recommended. We...	Recommended?	0
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.	It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.	0
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?	What of it?	0
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.	Do it my way.	0
Who'll I aim at?	You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.	0
And what did you do tonight, honey?	I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.	0
Planned what?	Agreed.	0
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.	There's no happier thought under heaven.	0
He said you didn't have one.	What's he talking about?	0
Why do you hide in my room?	But surely you must know -- because I love you.	0
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...	And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?	0
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.	Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.	0
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.	Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.	0
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...	I guess so.	0
Egypt.	I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.	0
Anything wrong?	No, no.	0
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--	Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.	0
I'm a little nervous, so...	I thought you might have.	0
Are you sure you're OK?	Yeah I'm fine.	0
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.	What time is it?	0
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.	Yeah, that one.	0
You're sure this is a good idea.	Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...	0
Well, personally, I never went for church names.	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.	0
That's stupid.	No, Dr. Grant says...	0
I know.	Underneath all the bullshit, just love.	0
I see you read the book.	Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!	0
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.	The Italian, I presume?	0
Wisconsin.	Uh, you're driving a-	0
I don't know.	Why Edie, Ió	0
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.	Know so.	0
Can we go up to the crime scene?	You know you can't do that.  C'mon.	0
Joanne?	You know her?	0
You want me to stay?	Yes.	0
Don't hurt him...	But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.	0
My uncleóMother's brotheróhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."	Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?	0
What was that all about?	Can we just forget it?	0
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?	0
Who is it?	No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.	0
You tell me.	I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *	0
That way.  You?	That way.	0
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	0
I'm going to the senior dance.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.	0
Well, those are the breaks.	Whatever you say...honey.	0
He's liable to shoot you.	On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.	0
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.	You found us okay?	0
For work.....	At a gas station.  Will you marry me?	0
Tell me what it was.	A car.	0
Why?	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -	0
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.	Thank you.	0
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?	Me.	0
I'm about to blow the wall.	Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!	0
Look.	Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.	0
You look awful good in that uniform, though.	Best part of the job.	0
Very little.	Too bad.	0
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?	Anything you want.	0
Oh, yeah?	It can be dangerous...	0
Yep.	God took her from us.	0
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.	Me neither.	0
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.	Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--	0
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.	That I am very little different from him.	0
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.	Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!	0
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.	Here's Judy Garland!	0
Just feeling a bit sick.	Oh, babe...	0
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.	Alright. How much you need, ho?	0
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.	What's his name?	0
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.	That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	0
I better go over and see her.	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womanóa trip like this.	0
Patrick Bateman's office.	Jean? Hello? Jean?	0
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!	Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.	0
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.	Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.	0
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?	A perfect moment?	0
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.	No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...	0
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.	Why's that?	0
What is it...?	It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.	0
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.	0
What do you want, Nick?	No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousÖBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?	0
Thank you.	They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.	0
You abide by rules like that?	Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.	0
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.	Not at all...	0
What are you going to do, Sam?	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.	0
No....	Off....	0
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.	I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.	0
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?	We will be fine!	0
Kinda gaudy.	Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?	0
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.	Oh, I don't remember that...	0
Who is this?	What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.	0
Hello. Get me the police, please.	Where is Elaine?	0
You repeat yourself.	I'd like to say it a thousand times.	0
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".	Nowhere?  I'm...here.	0
But if I don't plug it in how can I...	I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --	0
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?	You're not ready.	0
Huh?	Why don't you open it and find out?	0
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.	You're not afraid, are you?	0
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.	I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.	0
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.	Well --	0
Yeah, I did.	Who is?	0
I didn't know you had one.	Cause I don't get it.	0
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.	Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...	0
And I was in it?  What did I do?	I can't do it, Jani.	0
You mean a farm?	No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!	0
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.	We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.	0
I order you to find out where we are!	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.	0
"Thirty-two?"	No, nothing.	0
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.	Hey, I got an idea.	0
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.	Yes, Ben - he is.	0
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?	Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!	0
I was here yesterday.	I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.	0
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.	It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.	0
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.	I'll be there.	0
You will not hurt him?	Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?	0
I have my reasons.	Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.	0
His wife?	Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.	0
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.	Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.	0
You don't have to explain.	Well, I hope he wins.	0
Hi, Brad.	Sis.	0
Good afternoon--	Nah. You just relax. How's the book?	0
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.	And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --	0
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?	Sammy's?	0
But --	That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.	0
What'd you do, honey?	No.	0
Can you fly?	Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!	0
There's a nice boy.	Yeah.	0
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.	And a gymnast!	0
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.	And a *lot* of paper!	0
Nothing.	What do you want from me, Colette?	0
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.	0
What'd your father do?	Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.	0
Not really.	I'll see ya around, huh?	0
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.	How long have you been back?	0
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.	I told you, I knew your sister.	0
Of course it is.	Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.	0
Honey --!	You know what I'm saying, Joe?	0
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.	Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.	0
Sixteen next month.	Sit.	0
You're not interested in sex?	We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.	0
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.	Don't DO that!!	0
I know. Will you please leave now?	Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.	0
What are your favorite buildings, David?	You want to see some?	0
What's wrong with Parker?	How should I know?	0
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.	Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!	0
Pouring myself into my work.	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.	0
Hey! I didn't have to come back.	Yeah you did...	0
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.	She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.	0
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?	For them. But for me --	0
I never put myself in harm's way.	Anymore.	0
Excuse me.	To Misery.	0
What if you hide me?	With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.	0
Do you think about the game?	I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.	0
Yeah?	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!	0
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?	Oh, terrific. Which way?	0
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.	These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.	0
It's okay.	And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.	0
And, where did you see my portrait?	Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.	0
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.	He could have died.	0
Iím sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	Itís my job.	0
We're getting close...	I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.	0
...Yes.	I love the fragrance of chilidogs.	0
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.	You want me to come with?	0
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--	Tip top, Willie...tip top.	0
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.	That strikes me as odd.	0
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.	What, leaving school...	0
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.	Is she a Capulet?	0
P.M.	I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --	0
I knew he slept in a toolshed.	Wish I could say the same.	0
I'm not your daughter.	Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.	0
It's starting to let go!	That's good -- you're doing fine.	0
The fat man down there, on the bench.	You've come to lecture me?	0
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!	Don't make no difference no more.	0
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.	Huh?	0
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.	I'm sorry, I can't.	0
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.	I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.	0
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.	Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...	0
He treated me as if I were a child...	Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...	0
I guess so. Then what happened?	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?	0
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?	For chrissake give me a hand!	0
Thanks.	So tell me, how's it going?	0
He's a good man.	Better be. You left me for him.	0
'Been up north?	Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?	0
Okay.	Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.	0
That's right.	Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...	0
You don't even want to touch me.	Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.	0
Oh, Jim!	No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?	0
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.	I'm supposed to call in.	0
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?	Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?	0
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.	You'd better before you catch the disease!	0
Sam...	Put Kelly on too.	0
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?	Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.	0
-- He's in a cage?!	Well it's more of an enclosure really.	0
When?	Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?	0
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.	Who's responsible?!	0
You're angry--	Sixteen weeks is a long time.	0
So whose route is this?	You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...	0
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.	You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.	0
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...	I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --	0
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.	Then I will go with you.	0
We can't talk about it here.	Ah, well .... CUT TO:	0
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.	Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?	0
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?	I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?	0
You always want to run everything.	Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.	0
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?	I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.	0
What's the difference?	The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.	0
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.	Who cares ?	0
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?	Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]	0
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.	That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...	0
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?	But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.	0
Say what, Manray?	Did you ever sleep with DeLa?	0
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.	Elaine -- that is not what happened.	0
You are so brilliant.	Yep.	0
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.	You can.	0
Oh, hello, Peter.	I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.	0
What?	Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?	0
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.	No way, Jude. I'm out.	0
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?	No.	0
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.	John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.	0
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --	-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.	0
Shit.	Hello.	0
Merry Christmas, Rudy.	What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?	0
How much is a person supposed to stand?	You're gonna offer to set him up?	0
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.	What is it?	0
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.	C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.	0
A bully? Moi?	Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.	0
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?	Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.	0
I don't know where you'd start.	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?	0
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.	Oz.	0
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.	Okay.	0
PAUL!	DAD!	0
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?	Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?	0
The mental hospital.	What does he do?	0
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.	0
My God you look exactly like him.	Don't.	0
You actually forgot our anniversary.	Iíll fix it.  Iíll go out right now and get you something.  Iíll make it right.	0
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.	I'm Crash Override.	0
Go away! You've spoilt it.	Oh, sorry I spoke.	0
How long's he staying for?	Search me. I guess we're abandoned.	0
My God, Lenny.  What is it?	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.	0
Dade.	What?	0
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.	That sounds nice.	0
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.	Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!	0
Do you think I'm pretty?	When?	0
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?	"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...	0
What do you think?	There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?	0
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.	What are you doing?	0
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?	And Fridays? What do you do then?	0
Where's the rest of the team?	Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.	0
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --	It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.	0
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.	Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youÌve asked the question and you are the answer.	0
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut onó	Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.	0
I'm not.	I can't take him to work.	0
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.	Elitism?	0
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.	Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...	0
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.	Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.	0
One what?  Ah-ha!	Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?	0
Where?	Yes.	0
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.	But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...	0
Well...no, but --	Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?	0
I wish I could help you.	There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.	0
Where did it come from?	So-called?	0
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?	He must be. They're letting him go, right?	0
I donít want to be safe!	I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.	0
Learning was important?	Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.	0
Think it'll work?	I told her. I sounded off.	0
She was the only "Annie" you could find?	They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...	0
I've never been to it.	Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.	0
Not because of Ned.	Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?	0
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?	Well...I guess I can't.	0
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.	What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.	0
What's an audience going to tell you?	Yeah. It smells like snow.	0
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.	Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --	0
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?	But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?	0
Of course. Every day.	Oh. Gary's loudmouth.	0
Second drawer.	Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--	0
Nobody's saying they don't.	You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?	0
I must go.	Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...	0
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?	I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?	0
Can't you see?	Oh, yeah. There.	0
To who?  Are you asking me?	Me?	0
Did what?	I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?	0
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.	Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?	0
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.	I'm always open to learning new things.	0
You know, you never told me why you left the army.	It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.	0
What?	And your husband works for somebody else.	0
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!	Yeah?!	0
No good options left?	Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!	0
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.	Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.	0
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?	0
No worries ...	Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.	0
No.	What are you going to -- ?	0
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?	No.	0
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.	Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...	0
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.	0
What are you on about?	The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.	0
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.	Thank you. Now, where were we?	0
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...	...yeah...	0
My tits?	No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...	0
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.	I just talked to him.	0
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.	Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?	0
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...	It takes money to buy food.	0
In the dark... where I join him...	No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!	0
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.	They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.	0
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.	You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --	0
Don't you get along with your parents?	The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.	0
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?	Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.	0
What? Really?	What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?	0
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.	I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?	0
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.	Well, we must be who we must be...	0
What am I to do with the packages if...	Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.	0
Was there?	No... of course not.	0
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.	Yeah, but please don't do that.	0
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?	If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.	0
How do you know that?	You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?	0
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?	I don't understand.	0
Do you know it like that? By heart.	Honest?	0
Are you on drugs?	If you want...	0
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!	Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!	0
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.	I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.	0
I'm hungry, J.F.	I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?	0
... Fascinating.	What do you mean?	0
Your wife...	We're actually inside, aren't we?	0
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.	Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?	0
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.	I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.	0
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.	0
You're here.	What about the guy he put in the body cast?	0
You're the coward.	Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.	0
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.	Sort of, um...	0
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.	But I can throw it out of the window.	0
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?	I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...	0
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.	Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.	0
What made it...	It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...	0
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.	Your old beau?	0
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?	Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...	0
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?	Our Peter?	0
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...	Claire, I have to show up for the--	0
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.	Oh, yeah.	0
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.	Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.	0
You've slept with twelve different girls?	If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?	0
Jeffrey Wigand...	It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?	0
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.	She's dying.	0
Allison.	That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.	0
No. I'm the exact opposite --	I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.	0
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.	Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.	0
Then I'm doing fine.	What's new onna street?	0
Did Dickie's Dad go?	I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?	0
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.	Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.	0
Well, sure.	Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?	0
OK. Bye.	Maybe she has caller ID.	0
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?	Just part of life on the road, peanut.	0
Your ego is colossal.	I didn't know you were so kinky.	0
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.	There is.	0
How long have they been gathering there?	The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.	0
Lloyd, what happened...?	Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-	0
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!	I'm scared...	0
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...	Nothing -- only to be here.	0
Fine.	Only I'll turn it off --	0
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...	Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.	0
They think I'm nuts.	That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.	0
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.	How was it hard?	0
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?	Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.	0
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.	1000 meters...	0
Yes. Go ahead.	Where'd she go?	0
What? What have we done?	Take it easy.	0
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.	What was suspicious about him?	0
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.	She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.	0
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.	That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.	0
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.	Gently.	0
Steven --	In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?	0
Dance with me...	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?	0
Because I love you...	Then it's not too late for us...	0
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better óó to improve upon what was already done.	Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.	0
Oh, Bruce...	Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?	0
That's your fault not mine.	Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?	0
I'm so proud of you, Bud.	Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...	0
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?	Who's got access to my goddamn file?	0
How can I be together if I'm not together?	You're on somethin' again, aren't you?	0
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.	Am I a thing?	0
It's not your taste.	We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!	0
"And this too shall pass away."	Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.	0
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?	Hmm, nice.	0
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.	He always shows up when somebody's in danger.	0
Don't go in.	I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.	0
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?	Yeah ... You don't have rain either?	0
Wow.	So did I.	0
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.	Nobody was WATCHING?	0
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?	Thank you.  Shall I...	0
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.	Remember Lyle Barton?	0
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.	Uh.  That's me.	0
Our salute will be a kiss.	Yes... a kiss... salute!	0
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.	The last I looked, we were just talking things over.	0
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.	Like it?	0
It's a test.	Yeah?	0
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.	John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.	0
Oh. And that is -- mom?	How's that?	0
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?	0
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.	Nothing.	0
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.	Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.	0
Yes.	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.	0
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!	I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.	0
Uh... eighty two?	Eighty four.	0
You don't understand that do you?	Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?	0
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.	I think he got a little scratch, Mother.	0
You need to believe in something besides yourself.	I believe in you.	0
Why did you do that?	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.	0
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.	Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.	0
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?	0
I'm going to tell her.	Hey... hey.  Don't do that.	0
...How's the paintin' goin'?	He's in interrogation?	0
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...	He tried to kill you, Starla.	0
No one has ever dumped me.	Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?	0
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.	I just picked them up on the way over...	0
Charming. More delightful people crippled.	Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.	0
How?	Two kids tried to set me on fire.	0
You know what I'm talking about.	No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.	0
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.	You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?	0
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?	How do you know I've been with several women?	0
No.	Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.	0
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!	0
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.	She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.	0
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally	Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--	0
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?	Yes. I am very hungry.	0
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.	Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!	0
I didn't say that.	it will be all right, madam.	0
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?	Shit.	0
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.	Calm down, Beth.  Alright?	0
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.	Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.	0
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.	0
Have you ever been married, Miles?	No.	0
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'	Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.	0
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.	That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.	0
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.	I let him go... believe me.	0
You never said you wanted one.	I never said I didn't.	0
Yes.	Flares?	0
You've been cheating on me haven't you?	Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?	0
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.	So am I.  Just trying to get by.	0
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.	Don't confuse what we do with who we are.	0
You are too crude.	I might be, but you're not welcome here.	0
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.	Come here...	0
Allison.	Yeah? Allison what?	0
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.	-- please, baby --	0
And what is your profession?	Do you really mean it this time Gale?	0
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?	0
One minute but then--	Sure. Thanks.	0
I'd like to think.	Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.	0
No.	What do you think?  Guess.	0
Okay, okay. Okay.	Well, there's someone I think might be --	0
You were saying?  Your daughter....?	Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!	0
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!	You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.	0
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.	Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...	0
I found it at an outlet store.  I know itís a knock-off, but I think itíll look great on you...	--my number one fan.	0
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.	Yes... well...	0
So...	Kinda tough on the butt.	0
Take it back. Till you sell your book.	No!!!!!	0
What happened?	I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.	0
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."	I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...	0
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?	Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...	0
Joanne?	Yes.	0
I need your help.	Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.	0
What?	Oh sis. You're so tense.	0
Enough.	Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...	0
What happened to Shelly?	She just had a baby that's all.	0
Stay away from me!  Please...	Stop swinging the bat.	0
Better than old times.	I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.	0
Right.	What are you doing at home on a Friday night?	0
Who told you?	One of the accountants.	0
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.	Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.	0
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.	Anything bad about me?	0
What?	Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!	0
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.	0
If you're going to insult me --	What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.	0
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.	0
A home --	What about Ray?	0
That word again! I don't even know what it means...	It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!	0
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.	Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.	0
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.	...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?	0
You've got to listen...	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?	0
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.	0
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.	But Lana, you could --	0
Steve, I...	Nothin'.  Want another drink?	0
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...	I kind of got that impression.	0
You went from high school to the Agency?	No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.	0
People liked him.	Most people did, yeah.	0
I thought you had a girlfriend.	Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?	0
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.	Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.	0
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...	I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.	0
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.	That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.	0
You bastard.	It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!	0
Something serious has happened.	Who are you calling?	0
Scottie?	Ettore must be fed up with me by now.	0
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.	That doesn't make any sense.	0
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?	Hi, lady.	0
Did you really ask?	Switch nostrils?	0
So you're just going to be vindictive	Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!	0
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.	No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.	0
That was nice of you to think of that.	You manifested that, Beth.	0
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?	Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.	0
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.	Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.	0
Where are you, Mulder?	Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!	0
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.	You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?	0
And go to confession.	A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.	0
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.	Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.	0
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.	. . . What?	0
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...	Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.	0
Yes.	Was I?	0
It happened to you before?	A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?	0
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.	Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...	0
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?	Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.	0
Suspect Zero.	You asked me not to come.	0
Not another bill?	Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.	0
All I did...	You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.	0
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?	No. Not particularly.  How come?	0
Mutants?!	...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.	0
Get away from me.	And the money goes--	0
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!	Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.	0
I wrote the letter.	What did it say?	0
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.	... Good evening, Louise.	0
Don't I get a kiss?	The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -	0
What is this place?	I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.	0
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?	More or less.	0
-- hey! --	Older than me.	0
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.	But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.	0
A day like any other. People come, people go.	No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.	0
What's the title?	"The Day After Yesterday."	0
Whoever you are, don't call again.	It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.	0
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.	0
I work too, but I still make time.	Tina, what do you want me to do?	0
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?	Prevacid.  For my stomach.	0
He knows where I work.	Find a new job.	0
And when things get in your wayó or people óyou just knock them asideó get rid of Themó is that your idea?	Listenó get this straightó don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .	0
Frank --	That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.	0
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?	Why can't we be together?	0
Hicks, don't let him leave.	I wish there was one I wanted.	0
Kind of.	Okay.	0
Blake?  Dead?	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.	0
Fuck that.	What is?	0
How much time does that give us?	I didn't want to leave it there...	0
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.	You.	0
Is that one of the Who's Who?	Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.	0
You have no personality.	No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?	0
She didn't love you?	Damn, you're beautiful.	0
I canít believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnít want to raise the kids here?	No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.	0
Walter?	Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!	0
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.	Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?	0
Excuse me.	Don't calm down.	0
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.	I was in a bowling-alley.	0
Think this about money still, ya old fool?	Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?	0
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.	0
Wanna drink.	No.	0
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.	You just can't stop editing me. Huh?	0
What's "nothing"?	Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.	0
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!	How long have you been married?	0
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?	Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.	0
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.	Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.	0
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.	I'm not very hungry, thank you.	0
This isn't for real.	I will never forgive you.	0
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?	No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.	0
And?	They sure do stink.	0
The theatre?	Gotcha.	0
I know.	I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.	0
How long has -	He must be. They're letting him go, right?	0
I have a bad feeling about this.	And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?	0
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.	I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.	0
Why are you so uptight?	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.	0
No.	I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.	0
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.	Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.	0
Uh-huh . . .	You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?	0
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.	So?	0
But you knew that I'd -- die.	But you're beautiful... your skin glows.	0
... yes.	No!	0
You -- covered in my vomit.	Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.	0
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.	Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --	0
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.	She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.	0
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...	0
Yes.	Jesus, why?	0
You don't love ME.	No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...	0
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?	Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.	0
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!	Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?	0
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.	Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.	0
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.	Do you expect me to believe that?	0
He wants to see your map.	I'm almost done.	0
That's none of your business.	You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?	0
You're really one of us now, aren't you?	You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?	0
Uh-huh.	Was she there?	0
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.	0
3:30 I guess.	When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.	0
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.	0
You don't like it?	It's okay. For restaurants.	0
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.	No.	0
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!	I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--	0
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -	I swear to you, it's true...	0
Peter, let go of the chair!	What?	0
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.	I'll risk it.	0
I don't care.	Magic...	0
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!	Nothing.	0
I want to see you.	When?	0
He came to kill us.	And you want to know --	0
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.	Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.	0
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."	No problem. I'm not in a hurry.	0
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.	And do what?	0
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?	THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !	0
Don't you?	Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.	0
I had a spot of bother at the door.	I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --	0
Could you do me a favour?	It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.	0
But why would they --?	You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.	0
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.	So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.	0
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.	0
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.	Uh-huh.	0
But in the same house, you know, one house.	-- Sure.	0
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.	You're right.  It does sound strange.	0
We won't. Let's go inside.	Wait a minute.	0
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.	You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?	0
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.	Look deeper.	0
Oh, he's a keeper all right.	Colette ...	0
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.	I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.	0
Kiss my booty.	Plan to.	0
Damned if I know. She ditched me.	You weren't supposed to leave her alone.	0
Hello--	... All right.	0
Murphy kid turn you down?	I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.	0
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Heís decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.	How long has he been with you?	0
After he tried to shoot you?	He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.	0
No	Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.	0
You know what I want, babe?	I found the pentacle.	0
Yes, I know.	So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.	0
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.	Rae...	0
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...	It has nothing to do with--	0
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.	0
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.	And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?	0
You can't.	Why?	0
Let's go in.	Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.	0
Is he really all right?	Me. It's Eddie.	0
I don't know.	I'm not going anywhere.	0
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."	What?	0
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.	Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.	0
Youíre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.	0
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.	You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.	0
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.	Hi.	0
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.	I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.	0
Do you want to go home, Ryan?	Yes.	0
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.	A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.	0
With pay!	Uh-huh.	0
What's weird about that?	Most women wouldn't choose it.	0
Paulie, please --	Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.	0
It's me?	The one in the street.  I chased after you.	0
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!	It's over!	0
You followed me!	HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.	0
You've said that already.	I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.	0
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.	Can we watch the monster movies?	0
Hmmm ...	Looks like rain, Steed...	0
Where will the money go?	Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?	0
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?	0
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.	What? Steady like?	0
She said, "You know."  That I know.	Do you?	0
You said you wouldn't laugh!	I've never seen a lobster.	0
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?	Yes.	0
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.	Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.	0
You'll like it here.	The only one.	0
Oh, yeah?	I, yeah.	0
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?	I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.	0
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?	I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.	0
Too much blue in crimson.	Tarazine?	0
Really?	I'm going to answer it.	0
That's not true!	Oh!	0
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?	It's taken care of.	0
Yes.	Where? In the leg?	0
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.	You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.	0
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.	It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.	0
You bet I've got a better offer.	Feel good?	0
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.	Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.	0
Knox, I don't believe this!	I'll mention it upstairs.	0
A funeral.	I apologize.	0
Still.  All's fair in love and w...	One more. Smile. One more.	0
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?	0
Lucky you.	Carnations.	0
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.	It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.	0
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?	I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?	0
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.	OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...	0
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--	About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?	0
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.	What's your mother doing this afternoon?	0
Marcie.	Thank you.	0
Jesus, Caesar!	A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.	0
Just what do you think you're doing?!	It wasn't much of a letter...	0
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?	None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.	0
Thank you, Panes.	Awake? What do you mean?	0
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?	Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?	0
Fine, sheís the kidís dog.  Letís go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.	But itís twenty degrees outside...	0
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.	Yes, I understand.	0
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --	It's a big and busy funeral home.	0
Listen, that was my fault.	What?  This is a good level, isn't it?	0
No, I'm going home.	Why? It's not dinner time yet.	0
He killed a man worked for him the other night.	Get away from the door, Beth.	0
Very much. Now, where were we?	What kinda music do you like?	0
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --	Why?!  I think she's very attractive.	0
Where's the dog now?	He left me.	0
To coincidence.	I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.	0
A certain weakness.	You hear me complaining about that?	0
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"	How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?	0
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.	0
How'd you know?	Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?	0
Ten million --	Now you understand why I'm here.	0
Are you asking me for a "date"?	No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.	0
Oh yeah?	Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?	0
Where are you from originally?	It won't work.	0
Why attack Russia?	Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.	0
Why can't you come...	Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore nowó but I think we're getting in love with each other.	0
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.	I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.	0
You want a drink?	Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.	0
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?	The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.	0
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?	To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.	0
He liked to laugh.	Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.	0
Jack...	A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.	0
I guess.	You never disappointed me.	0
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!	You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!	0
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.	Sloan knew which five, didn't he?	0
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.	Yes, I am.	0
That's what I said.	Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?	0
My God you look exactly like him.	I never knew my father. Did you?	0
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.	He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?	0
But what if something happens to you?	Hear this now: I will come for you.	0
Don't touch me.	I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.	0
Elbows, Son.	Sorry, Mom!	0
Fuck you.	Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.	0
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?	Is she here?  Is she coming?	0
What was it that made you know?	I don't think I could really describe it.	0
You said never to touch you before a fight.	Ok. Where are you from originally?	0
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.	Oh.	0
You don't like me?	I love you. I want to have your baby.	0
No.	For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?	0
Royalty?	All the best people.	0
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.	The touch?	0
No.	We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...	0
He was creepy.	Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.	0
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?	Photojournalist.	0
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.	Don't say that, Edie, don't...	0
Kirk. They're gone.	... Gone?!	0
You're kidding.	He had a mind that escalated things.	0
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.	That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?	0
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?	Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?	0
So what stopped her?	What theory?	0
Paranoiac!	Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.	0
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?	That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.	0
You drive like a maniac!	I call this the staccato.	0
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.	Ma'am?	0
Hey!	Bye Ma.	0
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?	STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...	0
It's gone now.	Because you have hope that you'll get better?	0
They're right here.	-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."	0
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.	What's that?	0
Why? Is this about the book?	No. Frank.	0
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.	Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.	0
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.	That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?	0
Who's he?	He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.	0
After that, who cares?	That does it ññ come here.	0
Do you?	It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.	0
Fuck, it's freezing.	Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.	0
Who?	Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?	0
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.	Right now?	0
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.	Yes.	0
So we're gonna be close next year?	You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.	0
Did Sharon say no?	You know I want to go with you.	0
Are we going to build our little house?	Yes... a little white house.	0
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?	Are you doing some kind of science project?	0
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.	Being a jerk is better than being nothing.	0
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.	Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.	0
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.	Got another song for us?	0
What am I to do with the packages if...	Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...	0
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?	Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.	0
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.	The doctor.	0
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.	I don't know.	0
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.	Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.	0
...I'm positive this time...	...Please stop...	0
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.	Take care of him?	0
Not...gray.	You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?	0
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.	What?	0
You didn't know?	Yes...<i>yes</i>...	0
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.	0
Bread?	Thank you.	0
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.	You're trying to make me feel guilty.	0
After the movie.	And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?	0
Aren't you?	I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?	0
Thank you, kind sir.	But you're beautiful... your skin glows.	0
John thinks I'm so snotty.	You are.	0
Then we cannot go.	Because...?	0
I know.	So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.	0
I'll do it.	No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?	0
Assumed name... Houston.	Yah.	0
You promised, Tommy.	I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.	0
I can't do this. It's not right.	What's not right?	0
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?	Yes.  Especially toward the end.	0
Well, sure.	And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.	0
My ass if falling.	Your what...?	0
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!	Originality is my speciality.	0
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!	Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.	0
Sorry.	I wish I knew, Edie, Butó	0
Yes.	That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.	0
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.	No pain, no gain?	0
A flare?	From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.	0
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?	I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.	0
Take me away...	It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!	0
You want to see...	See what?	0
Great.	I'm gonna clean it up.	0
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!	Then why isn't there anyone around?	0
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.	0
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--	A real live pimp?	0
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.	No.	0
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.	Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.	0
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Especially with an election coming up in a few days.	0
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.	Well, thank you, Mary.	0
He'll kill you, Lenny.	My wife used to call me Lenny.	0
Is that something you're "feeling?"	Vietnam!	0
What did you do?	I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.	0
Will you call me?	I don't have your number.	0
Excuse me.	And into a black dress.	0
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...	I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.	0
Is he very much like you were?	Yes.	0
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --	You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.	0
Uh-huh.	Uh-huh?	0
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?	I... puppeteer.	0
She's finally asleep.	Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.	0
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?	Is he working?	0
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...	I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.	0
I'm not sure you answered my question.	Which one?	0
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.	0
Hi, Sean.	I heard you weren't coming.	0
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...	You didn't tell her?	0
Are you okay?	A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.	0
Is she...?	Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.	0
Can we turn the light on?	It's going to get worse, honey.	0
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?	All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--	0
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.	Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.	0
What's their name?	Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.	0
What did he want?	Calm down.	0
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?	...I'm sure that people are upset...	0
I wouldn't do it.	Wife of Edward, the king's son?	0
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.	Yeah, right.	0
So you can use it now?	Yes... I suppose so.	0
Oh, so now it's my fault?	I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....	0
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?	Nothing you don't want.	0
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.	Corporal Hicks!?	0
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.	Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.	0
You didn't have to do this.	- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.	0
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.	You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?	0
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.	No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.	0
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.	All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?	0
Who was she?	Someone like me, like you.  A pro.	0
You've got everything?	Really.	0
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?	Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.	0
So wadda you do with your girls?	Just chill.	0
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.	Good. Or should I speak slower?	0
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...	Again?	0
What's the problem?	Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.	0
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.	Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.	0
Why don't you help us?	Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.	0
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.	Why?	0
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.	Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.	0
What just happened?	All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.	0
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.	What about the life readings you picked up?	0
Shut up, Diz.	Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!	0
Of course.	Okay.	0
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.	It works a little.	0
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.	Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.	0
Hello?	<u>What</u>?	0
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.	Keep your voice down.	0
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?	0
It's not really important.	Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.	0
Dad - - Dad - -	Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?	0
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.	Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!	0
Sounds quite beautiful.	Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!	0
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.	Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?	0
You're poisoning that child's mind.	You got a minute?	0
The forager's back.	Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?	0
He's a ghost!	He's alive!	0
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.	And why do you say that?	0
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!	That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.	0
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.	You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.	0
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!	And he's a patient of yours?	0
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.	Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.	0
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.	Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.	0
Way to go, amigo !	I'm gonna need a squad leader.	0
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.	Dickhead?	0
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?	He's alright, but my Dad can take him.	0
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.	You don't mean?	0
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?	No.  I don't.	0
How come it feels the same?	I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.	0
Radio said negative five.	Negative five?	0
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.	Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.	0
Why? What's wrong?	Yes? -- Tomorrow?	0
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?	It doesnÌt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.	0
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.	Thank you.	0
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.	Just now?  Overnight?	0
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?	We moved out after that. Upstate.	0
Thank you.	Um, yeah -- thanks.	0
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.	Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.	0
People have put their trust in you.	They have done nothing of the sort.	0
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?	0
So I don't like tents, why--	I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.	0
I didn't realize I was out.	Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.	0
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?	If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.	0
What?	Bye.	0
You took Bill.	Then what else can we do?	0
I had a good time tonight.	Why should you care?	0
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.	I'll have you out in a few hours.	0
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?	No, I don't.	0
How much does this cost?	Two thousand francs.	0
Sartorius wants to destroy it.	It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."	0
No.	Then why do you want to talk about it?	0
--when you go away.	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.	0
In his apartment -	And where was his wife?	0
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...	I'll wait for you till seven.	0
Nothing about you.	From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.	0
Mania.	Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.	0
Is this becoming complicated?	I'm not sure that I care anymore.	0
No it's okay, I understand, really.	Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.	0
Uh-huh.	No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.	0
Be like a weight off your shoulders.	You know we're right.	0
Not to me.	Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.	0
Annie. Annie Hayworth.	If you want...	0
Kelly Scott.	Only one way to find out.	0
Yeah.	And then, uh, April...huh?	0
No.	What... what do you mean?	0
Yes.	It's the only true thing I know anymore.	0
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.	C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.	0
They did a pretty good job.	--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.	0
Ask her.	Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...	0
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.	No.	0
You and 'Honey'?	My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.	0
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.	Is that right?	0
Have you made up your mind?	About what?	0
You wanna go on a date with me?	Please, yes.	0
Where?	You said they're destroyed.	0
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?	Heck, no!  What?!	0
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.	Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.	0
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?	No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?	0
And that's the only reason?	Can you think of a better one?	0
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.	You want me to walk you?	0
We thought a doctor might help.	I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.	0
Then why did you ask me?	And he doesn't smoke?	0
Claire.	Claire.  Pleased to meet you.	0
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.	Who knows why they all left...	0
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...	Don't mix your metaphors.	0
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.	I don't know.  Where are we going?	0
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!	Sit down, leave the bag under the table?	0
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.	0
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...	I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...	0
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.	0
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.	It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.	0
Stupid.	Yah?	0
Why?	Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..	0
Uh huh.	I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.	0
Nice left you got there, jerk.	There's a way to get a guy's attention.	0
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.	Wrong.	0
He's dead.	We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.	0
Shhh. He'll hear you.	Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?	0
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?	I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.	0
With your dry wit and humor--	Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--	0
The next corner we can get a cab.	Still, you can't just write her off.	0
Yeah?	We're running out of beer and other supplies.	0
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.	Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.	0
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.	Duquette.  Forget him...	0
Take that back.	All right, I take it back.	0
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.	Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.	0
Even when you were young?	Nope.  Not even when I was young.	0
Who's dead?	My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--	0
What about me?	Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?	0
Am I as good as they?	Hmmm - good coffee.	0
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!	Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.	0
You guys going to a costume party?	We're superheroes.	0
Don't be scared, Walter.	I'm not scared.	0
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.	Nice job.	0
We are almost out of water.	He did?	0
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?	He can't stay up there.	0
Well, if it's all the same to you--	Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.	0
It's only a little way, Mr. August.	What do you mean?	0
And the truth frightened her?	Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.	0
Have you known him long?	Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.	0
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youóyou had it pressed.	What did he say, exactly?	0
Eddie? ...	Yeah?	0
No way.	Go!	0
What was that bang?	That's good.	0
Cut 'em...	Now... I'm in ...	0
I wish I hadn't heard --	I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.	0
Toss you for it.	I don't gamble.	0
On tape?	What are you doing here?	0
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...	"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?	0
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.	Pretty bad.	0
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.	I've never seen the ocean, either.	0
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.	Well, take them off.	0
Why?	Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...	0
I don't have any proof, Palmer.	Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.	0
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.	Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -	0
He's not in this class.	What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?	0
How do you know I will?	What?	0
-- very nice, very nice.	I do. I'm -- are you...?	0
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...	Who?	0
What do you mean?	That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.	0
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!	Go on, child.	0
You okay?	I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.	0
At least you were never lonely.	Nothing.	0
Make it my first born.	Make it our first date.	0
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.	When?	0
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?	0
Why does he want to kill me?	Do you know where he got the dumper?	0
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."	That's good... who?	0
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.	Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.	0
I...can't.	Yes.	0
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.	Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?	0
It still hurt.  A lot.	It's the worst job since keymaster.	0
Well, not much longer to go.	What is it, 97 days?	0
How much weight have you lost?	Then what else can we do?	0
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?	The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.	0
I hope you're well.	There's nothing left for me to lie about.	0
Fascist!	If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.	0
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.	0
You got me something?  What's the occasion?	Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.	0
Or an on-line computer.	That's crazy!	0
Yes.	What d'ya want to do to kill time?	0
Put it on my account, please.	I just want to know why you're here.	0
I'm playing to win.	Winning isn't everything.	0
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.	You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?	0
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.	I'll bet.	0
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?	Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.	0
Yes.	Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?	0
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --	They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.	0
...yes...	...wants a piece...	0
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.	Might be different in New York.	0
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.	And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.	0
Oh - in here.	But she's alright.	0
I could like kill a guy with these things.	It could be freezing, it could be raining.	0
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?	You! Don't make me laugh.	0
It's not going to happen.	You must, darling.	0
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...	Now, Aim --	0
Benjamin.	Yes?	0
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.	I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.	0
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.	No, you were brilliant	0
I don't think we survived the crash.	Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.	0
Can you see it?	There was so much going on.	0
Lots of things.	Anything bad about me?	0
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?	I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.	0
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.	Why didn't you say something?	0
That's what I said.	If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!	0
Yes, Addison.	They're not that dumb, after all.	0
It saw us!	It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.	0
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnít have to sleep with you to find that out.	He used your exact words.	0
I beg your pardon?	Yeah.  I know.	0
I'm really sorry, Max.	Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.	0
And this is how he came to the boat?	Yes.	0
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.	Get out, Mom!  Run!	0
I have done nothing against the ordnung.	Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?	0
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!	Wha'?	0
I don't want to go home.	I know. I don't either.	0
Why?	I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.	0
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.	Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --	0
I'm sure I --	Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.	0
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.	What were you fighting for?	0
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!	Oh yeah?	0
Frank...what's wrong?	Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.	0
...I'm sorry.	Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.	0
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.	It's okay, really.	0
There's nothing to tell.	Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?	0
It went real good.	Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?	0
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.	Loretta.	0
Oh, dear.	What's the matter?	0
I'm a doctor.	Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'	0
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.	0
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.	Sport, indeed.	0
Dad.  Do you believe me?	Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.	0
Hey...	School's cancelled.	0
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!	Picked his pocket, actually.	0
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?	0
I don't know if I can.	Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.	0
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.	There's nobody here.	0
I can't. I work.	I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.	0
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...	Would you know the room?	0
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?	Both.	0
We're going to Jersey?	East Rutherford.	0
What, What, I can't hear you...	Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!	0
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?	Had it with deals.	0
He knew Baby Suggs?	Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.	0
Five minutes and fifty seconds.	That idiot!	0
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.	0
I'm going to the dance.	What for?	0
I want to know. You tell me!	You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!	0
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.	It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.	0
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....	Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.	0
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.	Oh, you did? I didn't know that.	0
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.	Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.	0
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."	I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.	0
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.	Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.	0
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.	Ettore must be fed up with me by now.	0
What was that?	-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --	0
Boy. It sure has been a long time.	It's wonderful.	0
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.	Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.	0
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?	Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.	0
It's all right.	No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?	0
Thanks.	And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!	0
I hate outside! I hate it!	We'll be all right...  We will...	0
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.	So I noticed.	0
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.	Boyfriend?	0
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.	0
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.	Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?	0
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?	About what?	0
Of course.  I am married still.	Yeah?  What's your husband do?	0
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.	...I'm sure you do...	0
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.	How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?	0
I didn't say that.  You did.	Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...	0
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.	Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?	0
You ever think about killing another human being?	That's fine --	0
You don't have to go.	Yes mam...	0
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?	It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.	0
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.	Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?	0
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.	That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.	0
Leave me alone!	Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.	0
We didn't talk about it -- you did.	Is that it?	0
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.	I don't need sleep!	0
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.	Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.	0
Ahhhh...	They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --	0
David?	Exactly. Now I've been thinking --	0
Not yet, Mr. Clark.	I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.	0
It has no nobility.	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.	0
Virginia?!	You're always taking his side.	0
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.	I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.	0
I have cheerleading squad.	At the top of the Empire State Building --	0
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?	I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.	0
What?	Gambling's not about money.	0
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.	Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.	0
Is she a doctor?	No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.	0
No.	No?	0
To the Cucamonga shopping center.	About the baby.	0
Would you like me better if I were a nun?	Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?	0
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.	Well.  Congratulations.	0
It's true... what you said...	Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...	0
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.	Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.	0
Oh. What?	Very big spider.	0
I thought he said by the monkey house.	Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.	0
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?	This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...	0
You lied.	I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...	0
I want you to stay and find Wynant.	Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.	0
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.	It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.	0
Well if I don't who will?	- - a gizzard - -	0
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...	Don't.  We've had a hard night.	0
Yes!	I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.	0
But you're sure?	I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!	0
Aha. Poet or philosopher?	I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...	0
Oh, no, really, I --	She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...	0
What are you doing here?	Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.	0
And you honestly think that's what she meant?	People watched the movies in their cars?	0
What else can you do?	I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.	0
No.	People home.	0
Ok, ok. I'm back.	You forgot "sexy".	0
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.	What safe place is that?	0
There's nothing to say.	No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?	0
He looks perfectly fine.	I'm scared...	0
We split the money?	Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.	0
No, on the porch.	Oh yeah, and then what?	0
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.	Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...	0
What for?	Because I want to get married.	0
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?	Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...	0
How?	We met in court.	0
You making a feature?	I can't help it.	0
I don't need one.	Nothing, I guessÖ	0
Go where?	Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.	0
Nothing, thank heaven.	Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?	0
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.	We were supposed to be together.	0
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...	Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.	0
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.	What? To put one of these in my pocket?	0
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.	Nothing.	0
Good.	Marion, stop this.	0
Am I a member of this club?	You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--	0
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?	I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --	0
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's	He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.	0
I'm going out the front.	- - a gizzard - -	0
I just don't think it would work.	Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.	0
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.	I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?	0
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.	You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.	0
What did you say, Brother?	Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.	0
Oh my God...  You're blushing.	It's still a very sensitive memory for me.	0
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --	-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."	0
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.	0
Why not?	I was just different.	0
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...	Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.	0
Okay, thank you for asking.	You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.	0
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.	I know.  Get out here.	0
Not in the Nineties.	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.	0
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.	I've met you before.	0
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?	You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.	0
--You're a cop.	I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.	0
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.	What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.	0
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?	They do in Chinatown.	0
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.	You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.	0
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.	That wasn't the deal.	0
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?	I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.	0
The final countdown.	It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.	0
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?	0
What's that, honey?	There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.	0
Bye, Joel.	I love you.	0
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?	I can see that. Sure.	0
They're... not here anymore.	Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.	0
yeah, good, ok.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.	0
Promise?	Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.	0
No!  Why would I want to kill him?	Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.	0
And it's all over now.	Yes.	0
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .	Oh that's nice for you.	0
I don't.	And you believe her?	0
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.	Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.	0
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.	That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.	0
I don't care.	Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.	0
You don't have to say that.	I never say anything I have to.	0
Don't say that!	Well, what am I supposed to think?	0
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.	Put Kelly on too.	0
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?	Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.	0
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?	That's right. Three percent.	0
I've been dreaming about this.	Then you get it.  You'll understand.	0
How are you?	Good.  How are you?	0
I didnít know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Iíve known for five years. Heís known Iíve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnít speak about...	Now don't that call for an extra!	0
Isn't it better like this...?	Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...	0
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.	Don't you remember what they called you?	0
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.	He does landscapes.	0
A river pirate.	Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.	0
Did she talk about me?	Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...	0
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.	Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]	0
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?	I saw them kill him!	0
Poor creature...	Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.	0
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.	Really? You think so?	0
You okay?	Christ, sure... yes!	0
The turkey in?	Nice car.	0
That's Ed.	A lot of cakes.	0
We saw each other a little while ago.	...I had a dream about...something like that.	0
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.	I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?	0
Anything?	We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.	0
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.	I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...	0
Nope.	Did he put you up to this?	0
What about Jeremiah?	He did? When?	0
Must they always follow us?	Everything.	0
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?	You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?	0
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.	Why do you bring her up?	0
It's a shark's tooth!	So?	0
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?	Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.	0
I'm staying.	If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...	0
How'd the show go?	Okay.  How'd yours go?	0
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?	Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.	0
Doctor Jones?	Yes?	0
I can't.	Frank is coming?	0
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.	Yes you did.	0
We're from different worlds.	Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.	0
Sabotage?	Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...	0
I'm still second best.	You ever fly an F-14?	0
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.	Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.	0
Come on.	I can't take water, Kathryn.	0
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.	Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.	0
What am I going to do with you?	I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.	0
Are you all right?	Nope.	0
Careful.  What's wrong?	Nothing.	0
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?	Okay.	0
I wouldn't miss it.	I guess.	0
Is that true?	It's not that late in Seattle.	0
Is this how?	Will that help?	0
Soap convention.	Soap?	0
It's tainted money, Doctor.	What a beautiful thought, Marquise.	0
Give me a ride?	Philip.	0
Sheriff, I don't...	C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...	0
He doesn't have a temperature.	I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.	0
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.	Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.	0
Antihistamine.  For bites.	But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.	0
How'd you feel about it?	I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.	0
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...	Come here.	0
No Mac, please... I --	Don't look.	0
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.	I'll handle it.	0
What is it?	-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --	0
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.	Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.	0
Good-by!	There's soft music--	0
You're kidding me.	Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.	0
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.	I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.	0
You can't.	Thanks.	0
I have.	What do you think he saw?	0
The hell you call me?	Well, she had problems --	0
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...	Alexander Pope?	0
What's wrong?	Your eye.	0
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.	The what?	0
Fine.  That's great.	Is that it?	0
I'll have to come see you sometime.	Don't you agree, Jacques?	0
You bastard --	These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.	0
Alexander...?	Orion's belt...	0
It was wonderful.	I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...	0
Water or mineral deposits.	Waal, that's what I'm saying.	0
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.	Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.	0
Dad...	Luminal.	0
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!	No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?	0
All it takes is one second?	Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.	0
Great.	You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.	0
Not that one!	I like her.	0
A Chigro?	You're kind of a surprise yourself.	0
How'd you know that?	Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.	0
I don't know if I can.	Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.	0
Who's Linda?	Why won't you talk to me?	0
Something's happened to them.	I'm sorry.	0
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.	What does that mean?	0
What kept you?	You use words like that, you might make me mad.	0
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --	Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!	0
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....	...but big.	0
But... wait... there are things to say.	I already know it, Mary.	0
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.	Ni-notchka.	0
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?	To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...	0
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go óó right now.  Why are you going to do this?	I feel good anyways.	0
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.	You see your office?	0
You still think I kill people, don't you?	-- mmm --	0
Then go home, baby.	Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.	0
Sorry.	Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?	0
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.	0
Thank you again. Good-night.	Can I see you tomorrow?	0
What?	Why you sonuvabitch...	0
What?	Nice dress.	0
A lot's happened since last weekend.	But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.	0
What're we going to do?!	There's got to be another way out.	0
I'm just going to my car?	That's right on my way.	0
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?	Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?	0
You're not?	This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.	0
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.	You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.	0
It seems right to us.	I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice óó that's it, isn't it?	0
See you over there, Miles.	Ambitious.	0
Anymore ideas...?	And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?	0
Well... THIS.	Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?	0
You think that's too much?	No.	0
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.	I'm just being realistic.	0
Can you make it back up?	Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.	0
Hello?	Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..	0
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.	0
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --	No.	0
Oh Jesus.	Not talking. Writing.	0
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.	I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?	0
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?	I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.	0
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.	It's true. I wouldn't lie.	0
Put your arms around me.	Excuse me?	0
I want that shark alive.	Ynyr!	0
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.	Toss the flare down!	0
Oh. What's happening about the opera?	What?	0
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.	Kitchen's through on your left.	0
What?	Try to communicate with her somehow.	0
You lied.	...brazen-it-through...	0
You don't understand.	There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.	0
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.	Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.	0
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --	Because, I'll take it.	0
No.	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.	0
Eight o'clock?	What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --	0
Take care, Dad.	Call me tomorrow.	0
A sin against <i>what?</i>	Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?	0
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!	Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --	0
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.	So? What do they think -- we're not kids --	0
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.	0
Thank you.  Benjamin --	Pardon me while I reach for my beads.	0
Why do you want to do that?	You know why I want to do it. Just do it.	0
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...	C'mon. I've got the car.	0
I'm off.	Tom. You remember?	0
Oh, my babies.	Anais, it is so good to see you.	0
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.	That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.	0
Take care of her. She's a keeper.	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.	0
She needs help.	He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.	0
That was about a year ago.	Well, is he?	0
I've seen him.	You have?	0
But they'd still get the idea, right?	Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.	0
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?	Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--	0
A dozen?	In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.	0
Anything this time?	I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.	0
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.	I don't have any.	0
You're my prisoner.	I've got something to tell you.	0
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?	I doubt that.	0
Why, haven't youó?	Yeah I'll look into that tonight.	0
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!	Rose, you are too uncritical of people.	0
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --	Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.	0
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...	Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.	0
Not true.	Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?	0
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?	You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?	0
Professor Tripp.	Chancellor.	0
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.	Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.	0
Come home soon after the show.	I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --	0
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"	I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.	0
Andy, the theater's that way!	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."	0
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.	Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!	0
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?	Don't get funny with me again.	0
I'm just stopping by to say hello.	You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.	0
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.	Please.  Don't.	0
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?	Why not.	0
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.	Ok.	0
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.	No.	0
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.	0
I don't want you to let go.	Have you been to any parties?	0
Oh, yeah...	Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...	0
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.	Where'd she go?	0
So it was "love".	No, really, five thousand with your discount.	0
No. I feel more like - yodeling.	Yodeling?	0
What is that?	I slept with your sister.	0
I'm saying they came into my yard.	Would you tell me if you had?	0
You do?	Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.	0
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.	What. What don't I understand?	0
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.	Alright... okay...	0
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?	She's worried about the cow now.	0
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.	Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?	0
Oh.  Run.	What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?	0
Strange man...	-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.	0
Yeah.	You see?	0
What do you want, Melvin?	Were you asleep?	0
Not white, darling.	We'll speak soon.	0
Rufus?	Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.	0
Who's Norma?	Who's who?	0
If he were still alive, maybe.	How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?	0
What does that mean?	The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --	0
You were late.	I can't just walk away!	0
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.	I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.	0
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.	Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.	0
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?	So don't marry him.	0
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.	Glad to see you again.	0
Hello, Brigman.	Oh no.  Not at all.	0
How was it?	Yes.	0
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.	I won't even dignify that with a response.	0
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.	I'm doing fine.	0
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.	What were you -- a child actress?	0
No, I have my things in the car.	I want every second I can get with you.	0
What are you doing?	I wanted it	0
Philip!  The senior partner?	I didn't see that.	0
You don't think so? I do.	Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.	0
...I suppose.	A flack jacket.	0
What're you doing?	I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --	0
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.	He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.	0
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.	He's my father.	0
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?	From one professional to another, of course.	0
I guess.	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?	0
Sunlight... It destroys him.	Sunlight?	0
Is that the truth?	I'll never run again.  I promise.	0
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?	No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!	0
Stop it! Just cut it out!	Let's wait on the power cells.	0
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.	Never forgave him for what?	0
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.	I didn't know what else to call you.	0
No, don't tell me ñ you just got fired by your crazy boss.	There's a lot...I want to talk about it....	0
Okay.	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.	0
I'm not pretty.	Well... not in the common way.	0
He's not here. We're getting divorced.	Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.	0
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?	He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?	0
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-	Then what would be enough?  If we were married?	0
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...	That's not quite what I said --	0
Answer the question, please.	Really?	0
Really?	Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories ó I'm sick of this sort of thing.	0
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.	Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.	0
Bastard.	Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.	0
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?	Thanks are hardly necessary.	0
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.	0
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.	Ha.	0
Can I pour you one?	Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.	0
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested óin pigeons.	Shut up. I'm not listening.	0
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.	I love you when you're angry.	0
I'm just going to my room.	Great.	0
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...	Madeleine!	0
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...	Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?	0
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?	It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.	0
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.	That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!	0
And your head is hot.	That's ridiculous.	0
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.	So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.	0
Neo, how did you do that?	Do what?	0
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?	Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.	0
Oh, you think so?	Really, why's that?	0
Yes.	Do you like it when he asks you?	0
For how long?	I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.	0
You don't miss it?	I just know. I know you'll love it.	0
Will I like it?	You'll like it fine.	0
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.	Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.	0
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?	But --	0
The Conformist.	Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --	0
I sold them to you.	...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.	0
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.	But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.	0
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --	Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.	0
They're not obliged to tell.	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.	0
If I'd known you were alive --	It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.	0
Take care of yourself out there...	I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...	0
Do you want to take a session?	Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.	0
I hope so.	A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.	0
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?	Well, you sure do a good imitation.	0
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.	I do ... I cut "em...	0
What for?	Sure.	0
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.	Did I say something wrong?	0
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.	Emily!	0
Bottega.	I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.	0
