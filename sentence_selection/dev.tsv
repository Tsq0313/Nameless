Let's do it again.	Try laps. Say a hundred.	1
Oh, are you all right?	Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.	0
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?	I hear Alan's sick.	0
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.	When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --	1
I see.	Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.	1
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?	Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.	1
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.	Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.	1
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.	That's temporary.	1
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.	What? Quit hollerin'.	0
Fascinated.	I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.	1
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.	That's long enough to get out of town.	1
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...	You do business in Cuba with your husband?	1
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.	You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.	0
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...	OK. I'll stop talking then.	1
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.	What things?	0
Then we cannot go.	I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.	0
I don't.	This one has a special meaning.	1
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.	I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.	0
Oh!	Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.	0
And this is how he came to the boat?	Yes.	1
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.	No again?	0
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.	And switched keys.	0
That's sick!	Thank you.	0
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.	Nurse!	1
But you found another choice.	I did.	1
Who will?	No, thank you.	0
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.	In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.	0
Shell Oil?	Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.	1
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.	The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.	0
Oui. Perfect!	Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.	1
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?	I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.	1
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?	Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.	0
DePinto?	Brill.	1
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.	Maybe they will.	0
What are you doing... ?	Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?	1
Oh my God...we√≠re buried alive...	Aye.	0
Is this a bad time?	She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...	1
It goes on and on.	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.	0
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.	Good luck, Tracy.	1
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.	If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.	0
-- This play means a lot to me.	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.	0
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.	Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.	0
Who cares? Who cares?	What a guy.	0
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.	What do you mean, four more?	1
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.	Oh, hi.	0
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.	You can.	1
That's all?	Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?	0
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!	I appreciate the offer but you really don't --	1
No.	A BEER, please.	0
Mommy!	Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.	0
Oh, are you on the team?	No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.	1
Did you need it?	Yeah.	1
Ryan's novel.	Ryan's novel?	1
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?	The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.	1
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.	Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.	0
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?	What's that?	0
Ahem.	Did you just have a brain-fart?	0
I got it done.	What are you doing here?	1
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".	Ow.	0
Copy. And Lundegaard too.	Yah. Where are ya, Margie?	1
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.	Had one.  Didn't work.	0
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?	And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?	1
So maybe you'll come too?	No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.	0
I want you to talk dirty to me.	Oh. Okay.	1
Have they located my daughter yet?	Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...	1
You can't buy that kind of publicity.	That's good news.	1
Well, we ate everything without you.	We?	1
My baby!	He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.	0
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?	Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!	0
Now, what did I do to deserve this?	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.	0
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.	Yes.	0
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!	I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.	1
Oh my God, I look awful.	I understand of course. It is to be expected.	0
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.	Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!	0
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?	Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?	1
Wrong preposition...	A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?	0
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.	I won't be needing these anymore.	0
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.	Is that what you want?	0
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.	1
Are you all right?	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!	1
Uh-uh-why?	It's ok.	0
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.	He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.	0
What'd he say now?	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?	0
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.	1
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this...	1
Would you like me better if I were a nun?	No.	1
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	What -- the bug?	1
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.	The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.	0
Barely.	He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!	0
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?	I just thought maybe you and me could--	1
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?	I guess it was 1984, 85.	1
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.	I was attacked.	0
You've been with Gray again.	-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.	0
This isn't any better, Chris.	No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --	1
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?	No, never.	1
Can I open it?	Sure ...	1
What?	No shit?	0
Who are you?	That's a shame.	0
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--	I need some money right now.	0
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.	Right.  Well.	0
Fine.	It's too late now--it's *impossible*!	0
We split the money?	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.	0
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.	Well how do you feel about him, then?	1
Are you asking me on a date?	Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.	0
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.	Then what?	1
Yeah.  I'm here.	But there's no one here, darling.	0
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but√≥ you've been very kind.	Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.	0
Oh, something. . romantic?	That's the plan.  My word on it.	0
Wanna fuck?	Sure.	1
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.	But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!	1
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.	How?	0
Just like a ghost ship, huh?	Sure.	0
They're acting very strange suddenly.	Pre-opening jitters.	1
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.	Yeah?	0
Did I miss something?	I took your life. He gave you another one.	0
Noooo....	She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to	1
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?	She'll be all right.	1
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?	A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.	0
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?	Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.	1
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?	I don't think I am.	0
On his back, I suppose.	No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.	1
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!	Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?	0
I thought I was helping you.	Take off your God damn coat!	0
No.	Well then...?	1
Will you join me for dinner?	Are you sure?	1
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...	I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--	0
Why the gun?	Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?	0
Oh, you do?	Okay. Mix.	0
Four	I don't think you trust anybody, do you?	0
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!	Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...	0
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.	1
You mean, before she sank.	Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.	1
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!	Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.	0
Yeah.	Are you his girlfriend?	1
Uh-huh.	Frances...	0
That was sure swell ...	Oh. Thanks, Margaret.	1
Mi Jesus esta muerto!	Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.	1
Andy, the theater's that way!	Do you know the <u>seller</u>?	0
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.	What are we about to do?	1
And -- and --	How tired you are!	1
Yes.	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?	0
I'm sure that was the idea.	What did you say?	1
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.	He's an actor, so it can't be good.	0
All set for what?	I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.	1
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?	No.	1
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.	I came back 'cause you were here.	0
Are they ready yet?	No, sweetie, not yet.	1
There√≠ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it√≠s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?	I wouldn√≠t mind. Thank you.	1
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...	Just what I said. Don't look so scared.	0
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.	Transfer.	0
I'm frightened, Mitch.	Well, I do.	0
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.	When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.	1
Uh, hold on...	I have to tell you something.	1
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?	Yeah --	1
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.	I guess I owe you my life.	0
No.	Have to wait.	0
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?	Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?	1
Parts of it.	Which parts?	1
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?	STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...	1
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.	Anything but Japanese.	0
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?	1
There is no us, remember?	Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.	1
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?	0
Where have you been?	Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--	0
Seventy-two miles an hour.	A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?	0
With what?	Just dinner.	0
The Conformist.	It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.	0
Same. Any luck?	No. I'll try again later.	1
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?	I'm wearing it.	1
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.	I don't know... he fell.	0
I know.	Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.	0
I know.	I have no idea who you are.	1
Oh, I'm fine.	What...what about your script?  So what's it about?	1
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.	Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --	0
I LOVE YOU.	Yeah Kay, I'm here.	1
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!	That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.	0
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.	Have some.	1
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.	Just saying it's not hard to end a life.	1
I'm sorry, sir.	When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.	1
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.	So you weren't interested in music at all?	1
Dick.	Exactly.	1
Somewhere else, that's for sure.	Married?	0
How did you find out about the toxin?	If you like 'em like that.	0
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -	So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --	0
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.	Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.	1
I'm serious.	He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.	0
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.	I've got you.	1
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."	That's it!	1
Don't worry. It's a test.	If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.	0
What?	But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.	0
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?	Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.	1
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.	All my model planes.	1
That's right.  What's she doing?	All right.  Camera!  Action!	0
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.	Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.	0
I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?	1
But if he knew we have so little time -	What do you mean?	0
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.	I can't believe you're still here.	1
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --	-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.	1
Rex. Get away from the door.	I get that impression.	0
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.	Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.	0
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'	If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.	0
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.	How much more do they need than your death at his hands?	1
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?	0
Hey, you!	No -- it just doesn't look right.	0
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?	0
So, what's on your mind?	Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?	1
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.	There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.	1
Good-night dad.	Good night kiddo.	1
What's she like?	Okay.	1
Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?	1
You mean you know about this?	Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?	0
You really are having a mid-life crisis.	I only protect myself -- !	0
Hi, Jack.	Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.	1
What, are you trying to handicap me?	I call that regular.	0
Oh. Well, what's it on?	A cloud.	1
Love it!	I dance...	0
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.	Huh?	1
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!	I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!	1
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.	You want me to come with?	1
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.	As in the...?	1
Sure. It'd be fun.	Sure.	0
We cannot go through there....	Oh, yeah?	0
What are you going to do?	Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.	1
Are you okay?	Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.	0
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?	I found Lisa Henderson.	1
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?	You mean...and orgasm?	1
To us. To the Mask.	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.	0
That's just --	Look at this.	1
Mineral baths - now really!	Where did you learn to kiss like that?	1
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.	'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?	1
Are you attracted to me?	Yes.	1
I'm sorry.	Please.	1
How do you feel about getting old?	You're not old. You look great.	1
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...	Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.	0
One more shot?	The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.	0
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?	Hurry up.	0
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...	Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.	0
Well what do you want to talk about?	Yes.	0
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?	Got it.	1
They go. John. They go.	A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.	0
My ex-husband was a lawyer.	Really. How wonderful for you.	1
Sure, why?	Yes, of course, -- money!	0
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.	He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...	0
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?	I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --	0
This is the second opinion.	He needs me, ma'am.	0
We're better off by ourselves.	Well, I don't...	0
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.	Less ten percent.	1
What do we do?	That's what they pay me for.	0
Why?	A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.	1
Yes.	Did you go home with him?	1
You.  What' you're doing --	Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?	0
Maybe he's wet?	I can't do that.	0
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?	What, leaving school...	0
Kinda gaudy.	He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.	1
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?	Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.	1
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --	Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.	1
Three.	Done.	1
Why?	I net a guy in a bar.	0
You mean you can't fall in love?	Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?	1
I asked you first.	Yeah, but I'm buying.	0
This rig? Phht.  No problem.	So I'll see you this weekend.	1
Meaning?	Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.	0
Jacques...?	Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.	0
She died.	Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.	0
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.	A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.	0
I don't know...	Hello.	0
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?	1
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.	0
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.	And what's that?	1
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!	Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.	0
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!	Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!	1
Prison?	I was the Warden?	1
I like "godsend."	I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.	1
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.	Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.	1
What the hell's that -- ?	A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...	1
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...	0
Bye-bye.	What's your real name?	0
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?	Yeah, sure.	1
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?	Can't fool around -- You look very great.	0
N-no, sir?	Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.	1
...What happened?	Lois, I . . .	0
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.	Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?	1
Oh.	Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.	1
Thanks for the backup.	How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?	1
I started to get serious about seven years ago.	Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.	0
The forager's back.	Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...	0
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"	Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.	1
You gotta admit, they do love him.	Sorry if I crossed you up.	0
Um, because you didn't want to go.	What?	0
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?	Who have you talked to?	0
What happens if they don't do that?	I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.	1
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --	Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...	1
I'm coming with you.	No.	0
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.	Tell us about it.	1
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.	Advances?	0
Paranoiac!	I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!	1
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?	What do you mean?	1
It is not.	Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.	1
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.	0
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!	Um-hum.	0
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".	Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.	0
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?	No she didn't...	0
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.	You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.	1
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.	That'll work.	1
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.	1
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.	No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?	0
There's nobody here. Jason...	She's pretty special.	0
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.	To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...	0
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.	You have any children?	1
You're positive of that, aren't you?	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?	0
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.	Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.	0
Sleeping pills.	I'm fine.	0
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.	And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.	0
You play all these places?	He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.	0
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.	Yes.	0
So the guy's not a sicko.	Well, I really don't drink...	0
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.	He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.	1
When you've got money, you'll pay.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?	0
Were you watching me?	And...?	0
I don't like coconuts.	Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?	0
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --	Look who's talking!	0
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?	I love you, too, Mama.	0
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.	All right.  Camera!  Action!	1
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!	... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.	1
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?	The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.	1
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.	Why would we do that?	1
Brady! Come with us.	It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.	0
...I'm going to kiss you.	I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.	0
So... they didn't...	No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.	1
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?	So do you.	0
No!	Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.	0
You did.	You must admit I have good taste.	1
Sorry.	What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.	1
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?	No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.	0
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.	Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...	1
I know.	It does matter. We're in love.	0
What's your problem?	And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?	0
Like you're from N'Yawk.	Give me 30 years, I'll get it.	1
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?	That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.	1
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!	You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?	0
Take it. damn it!	Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...	0
The play's going to be really good.	Vada, this is an adult writing class.	0
I know. Don't say anything.	He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.	1
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?	0
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.	No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!	0
In the kitchen.	Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!	0
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.	Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?	1
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.	You hurt it?	1
Your view of what?	They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.	1
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...	They just don't want us going in there.	0
Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?	1
Pete... Don't...	How'd it happen, Alice?	1
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.	No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?	0
This whole place?	Oh, I see. What do you use instead?	0
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.	What's going ON!!!	1
So it's all worked out perfectly...	That's her.	1
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.	I promise not to run off to Cancun.	1
Oh? And what should I say?	Just...say...no.	1
When do you think they'll come?	I don't know.	1
But I just wanted to say --	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.	1
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.	Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.	1
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?	Okay.	1
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.	Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.	0
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.	So you're gonna act salty all night?	1
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!	But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.	1
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.	I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.	0
What are you <u>doing</u> here?	Do you come here often?	0
Why did he come to you?	No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?	0
What?	Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.	1
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?	Who?	1
Where downstairs?	And what's that supposed to mean?	0
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?	I still want to look over a couple of things.	1
He must have.	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?	0
What?	It couldn't have been.	0
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.	So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.	0
Hey Sandy.	Okay.	0
Hey, Barry.	Oh, hi.	1
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.	1
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.	1
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.	In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.	0
That's a simple subject.	But it's light in there now.	0
Yes.	Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --	1
Don't even go there. What's up?	Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.	1
How do you do?	How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?	1
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?	Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.	0
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?	I was going to fake it.	0
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?	Yes.	1
Oh, come on. It's early.	Where are we?	1
Power levels quite low, sir.	Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?	1
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.	How long have you been into wine?	1
This is my good John Brown.	Yes.	1
Oh.  That's nice.	That's the question I want to ask Job.	0
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?	Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.	1
You liked the guy, though.	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.	1
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Do√ía Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?	I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!	1
Leah just told me you were going with her.	And this is your "work"?	0
Do bullets really bounce off you?	Only when somebody shoots them at me.	1
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?	Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.	0
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".	Let's see.  Where's it from?	1
A lot's happened since last weekend.	But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.	1
... Who are you?	What are we about to do?	0
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?	... acts like she's thirty-five.	0
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.	Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.	0
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.	And I intend to be there when she's ready.	1
Why?	To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.	1
No, Nick, please --	Who?	1
What is it?	Just some fatherly advice.	1
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.	Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.	1
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."	I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.	1
No, I mean --	And General Savitzky.	0
Promise me, Benjamin.	Nothin'?	0
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Hi.	0
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?	Very much.	0
Okay.	Hey, what I did for you is working out?	1
What's keeping you?	Oh, Charlie again.	1
Why did you come tonight? To see me?	You don't, do you?	0
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.	It's all there. It's no dream.	0
You were actually at Hamunaptra?	Listen. I had a great time.	0
..."The Devil?"...	...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.	1
How about dangerous curves?	Of trust. Tell me your plan.	1
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.	I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.	1
The final act? Well let's play asshole!	That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!	0
Hi. Nice to see you.	She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.	1
Tell me more.	You wouldn't believe me.	0
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.	Illusions, Madam?	0
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...	Is what you said about the ring but another dream?	1
I'm sorry.	Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?	0
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.	Very good, Madam.	1
Thirty -five years!	You do?	0
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...	Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.	1
That's going to cost.	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?	0
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!	No.	1
Are you worried about tomorrow night?	Not really.	1
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.	Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...	1
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?	Why, yes.  Thank you.	1
What's that?	What? What?!	0
Mr Brown.	We were going together before I ever let go of you.	0
Right, for us. But...I√≠m afraid that if you get on that plane...	What?	1
You talk to Carl ?	Yeah.	0
Hank?	Yes.	1
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.	Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.	1
I don't know.  I'm all right.	Really?  You sure?	1
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.	My act?!	0
What about?	Huh?	0
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.	Why not?	0
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.	I should have done this a long long time ago.	0
Mm.	"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.	1
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?	But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...	0
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?	This is New York City, it√≠s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren√≠t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...	1
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.	I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.	1
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.	I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...	1
That's abnormal.	I'm not ready for marriage.	1
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?	0
You really want to do this, don't you?	What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?	0
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.	Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.	0
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?	It's all yours.	1
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?	I just need you to be safe.	0
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.	Incredible similarity.	1
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -√≥ you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister √≥√≥ whom I had lost and have found again....	I know √≥√≥ I shouldn't have told you√≥	1
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.	Take your time.  I don't care.	0
So where is he?	Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?	1
Why?	You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?	0
Austin, may I have a word with you?	You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.	0
That was very interesting research George was doing!	Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.	0
Do you like pink?	Did you ever sleep with DeLa?	0
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.	Keep moving --	0
Fuck you.	I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.	0
He' s confused--	Aren't we all?	1
Oh, please...	So she seems.	0
Thank-you.	I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.	1
A page-break signal.  A period.	Not if you think like a Vegan.	1
I don't.	You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?	1
Boo!	YAAA!	1
Then get him.	I only protect myself -- !	0
No, he's not.	A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.	0
You know you can come under the blanket.	It's alright.	1
Will you take me with you?	Why, Jessica? You're still a green.	1
I don't really know.	One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.	0
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?	Riding with Judith.	0
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.	I wouldn't read too much into it.	0
Stop it. I'm...	On a lot of lithium?	1
You're begging him to kill you?	Just the way I remembered.	0
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.	If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?	1
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.	Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.	1
Huntington Beach, California.	It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.	1
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.	Then you would have gotten your money?	1
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?	High tech. I like the sound of that.	0
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.	Uh-oh...	0
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?	All right.	1
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.	I won't make any noise.	1
- and for you.	You're quite a girl.	1
Sure.	Ok.	1
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?	They're killing the Wigand interview...	0
Why not?	They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....	1
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.	That place is four hundred dollars a month?	1
... How long?	Yeah.	0
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.	1
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.	They sure do stink.	0
Well I want to leave.	Goodbye.	0
What happened to us, exactly?	But they have.	0
Why do you have to defend her?	I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.	1
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.	Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.	0
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.	Not too good.	0
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.	So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.	0
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.	Why not?	1
Good. You're just what I need right now.	You got a minute?	1
George... how about Felicia?	Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.	0
You're kidding.	They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.	1
Not at all. Why d'you ask?	It's not important good night.	1
You'd never understand.	I'll see you later.	0
When?  Where?	He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.	0
Does everything have to have a point?	It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.	1
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...	Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.	0
So how are you really doing, Panes?	Why don't you go fuck yourself?	1
Let's just be sure.	Can't do it.	0
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...	Yes ma'am.	0
Well, good night, then...	You going to sleep here, all by yourself?	1
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -	Go!	0
Do you?	And what did he say?	0
Brady!	No.  Are you're leaving?	0
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.	How hard they making it on you?	1
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?	Yes.	1
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?	I couldn't help.	1
Not a pressing issue.	Right.	0
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.	A perfect moment?	0
What difference does it make?	Is Ray going?	1
It is.	You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?	0
You fit another Chanel suit in here?	Something better.  Open it.	1
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.	Thank you.	1
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.	Interesting analogy.	1
You might have killed him!	Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.	1
This time I was trying to do everything right.	Don't just become excited.	1
You bastard.	Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.	0
How do you do it? Every night?	Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.	1
Are you a writer too?	No, I'm an actor.	1
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!	Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.	1
Ben where do you have to get to?	Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.	1
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.	1
A straight line.	For what?  He left.  Not me.	0
Then why go back now?	Still trying to figure it out myself.	1
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?	1
Kiss me.	I said I wonder if you could help me.	0
You're not going to --	I'm not.	1
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.	Well, now that you've mentioned it -	0
Never eat before the show.	I must say I found it rather appalling.	0
I didn't say that.	Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?	1
Mr Lombard...	But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.	0
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.	City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...	0
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.	Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...	1
Just now.	My God. I haven't seen you since...	1
Oh.	Marylin!	0
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?	0
I like the colors.	Nope.	0
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.	Interesting.	1
Were you in love with any of them?	No.	1
You mean, the insurance frammis?	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.	0
He doesn't know about the Day Care.	Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?	1
Of course.	Why?	1
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?	Maybe she's with Josh?	0
Damn straight.	Over the gold.	0
That's really strange. What does it mean?	I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.	0
What do you mean?	Leave the pills. I'll take them later.	0
Yes.	And what do you recognize, names or faces?	1
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.	Well, yeah, but --	0
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.	Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.	1
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?	Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.	1
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!	If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...	0
Just remember the needle in the haystack.	I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?	1
Promise me one thing.	Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.	0
And Annette's it for you?	For now. These relationships never last too long.	1
He'll kill us.	Are you positive he knows?	1
Hi, Peter.	I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.	0
Huh.	What do you know about Conrad?	0
Huh?	Oh, pretty good.	0
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?	I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.	1
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?	John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...	0
WE are over.	WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.	1
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.	You were having a nightmare.	1
So what do you want to see?	Mars.	1
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.	And if I win?	1
My ass if falling.	Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.	0
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.	Why not just buy your baby a night light?	1
I was?	Really? Tell me about it.	0
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.	That's it?	0
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.	Oh, hi.	0
I'm still second best.	I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.	0
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.	Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.	0
But...are you engaged or something?	Pardon me?	0
No.	Cute.	0
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.	Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --	0
I don't know you.	Ahhh, but I know you.	1
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --	A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.	0
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.	1
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --	What was your name again?	1
You knew Sergeant West?	Did it work?	0
Hey.	You having fun?	1
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?	He used your exact words.	0
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...	Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!	0
Why did you do that?	Soon honey, soon.	0
Who?	You.	0
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.	-- he'll never know the difference.	1
I'll need the Rembrandt now.	Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.	1
They're coming.	Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.	0
H'm?	I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.	1
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?	That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse √≥√≥  -- used a phony health inspector's badge √≥√≥ they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.	1
Occasionally, but always with affection.	Oooh.	0
Psychiatrists make you nervous?	No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!	0
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.	You wouldn't.	1
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.	I never *asked* for any responsibility.	0
Murdered...? How?	The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?	1
Why must you know?	How about another beer?	0
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.	Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!	0
Hello?	Just taking your photo.	0
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.	Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.	0
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?	Was over to Baby Suggs.	0
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.	I'll never love anybody else.	1
There were three strawberries.	One.	1
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.	Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.	1
It sure is good to be home....	It sure is....	1
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.	We just can.	0
Oh, God...	Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...	1
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.	You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?	0
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?	Peanut butter.	1
Mac's signature.	Oh, that√≥	0
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.	I cut myself.	0
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.	Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.	1
You're hurt --	No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.	0
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?	Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?	1
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.	Really? No kidding.	0
How old is she?	Fine.	0
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?	What the hell is that?	1
Are you sure that's what you want?	I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --	1
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.	Must've been a cheap date.	1
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.	0
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?	What!	0
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.	Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.	1
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.	0
Oh, yeah.	I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.	1
He hates all my race.	I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.	1
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.	I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.	1
Don't look so freaked.	I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.	1
What's her name?	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!	0
Yes.	I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.	1
Yes.	I don't see why not.	0
That bad?  Old or young?	Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.	0
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.	I can't believe this is happening.	1
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.	1
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.	Bad people.	0
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?	She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.	0
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.	Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.	0
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.	Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.	0
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.	Really? I kinda like it.	1
Where are they?	You live with him.	0
That was sure swell ...	You're serious?	0
So it's all worked out perfectly...	Baby, don't do this. I do love you.	0
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.	What do you think?	1
I never knew that.	He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.	0
Really, now is not the time to make waves.	Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.	1
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.	Here comes Daddy.	0
Understood, sir.	Dismiss the company.	1
She... she fell over backwards.	No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?	0
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.	) What?	1
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.	Not to me.	0
Treadstone.	Yeah, downtown.	0
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.	So what?	1
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?	My agent.  I called my agent.	1
He was all right to me.	Nothing more? Just another feller?	1
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.	When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.	0
I told you I'm not easily shocked.	Shut up.	0
It's locked.	It's locked?	1
Did you get us a room?	What?	1
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?	I was.	0
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...	Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.	1
I think I've found out about the money, sir.	When I'm dead--  or fucking.	0
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.	Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.	1
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.	I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?	1
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?	Oh.  Well.  Good.	0
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.	I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.	0
Like you.	I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.	1
-- so when are you going to Egypt?	Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.	0
Where are you going?	She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.	1
This could be it!	This could be it!	1
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.	Claire...!	1
No dances, just tell me.	The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.	1
What do you want me to do.	You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?	0
You bastard --	Poor baby.	1
Getting to what?	You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.	0
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!	Thirty feet???	1
You went to those brain butchers?!	What's wrong can never be made right.	0
We never met in court or anyplace else.	You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.	0
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.	Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?	1
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.	Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?	1
What will happen to him, Ted?	The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.	1
Eduard wanted to marry me.	And you ...?	1
Look at her face. A real bitch.	Wait--	0
I'll take you up on that.	Goodnight.	1
Where did you find this clown?	We might as well pack.	0

Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.	0
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.	It's the best collection I've ever seen.	0
Yes?	I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.	1
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.	I don't know.	0
Isn't that beautiful?	You√≠re not married, are you?	0
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?	Why?	0
Thank you.	Sure.	1
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."	Over the gold.	1
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.	That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?	1
I think you know that.	Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?	1
Thanks. What are you doing?	I beg your pardon?	0
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.	Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.	0
What are you doing?	Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...	0
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.	That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!	1
I don't understand --	There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?	0
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.	Is that right?	0
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.	You invited me.	1
So what do you keep in there?	Maybe.	0
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.	Marty...	1
You're begging him to kill you?	If he thinks he's man enough.	1
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--	1
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.	Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.	0
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.	It's all right -- You're my guest.	0
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?	One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.	1
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...	No?	0
What are you asking me?	No --	0
Page three of the Post.	Ohh...	1
Excuse me.	Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.	1
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?	Yes, it is.	0
I don't know how....	The mother sure has her hands full.	0
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!	I don't --  Do that stuff.	0
Hunh.	You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.	0
No.	Are you sure?	0
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?	Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.	1
xxxxxx	Only Lisette?	0
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.	0
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?	What?	0
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.	I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.	1
It's lovely. . .	I hear Alan's sick.	0
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?	What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.	1
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?	0
It's not fair to you.  This whole --	Tell me -- let me help --	1
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.	No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.	0
What the hell is going on?!	I wish I knew.	1
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.	Line?	0
Gabriel, let him go --	We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...	0
I don't.	So where's the harm?	1
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.	I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.	1
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.	I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.	1
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...	I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.	1
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...	Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?	0
It's called Black Leather.	He will.	0
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?	What?	1
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?	[Beat] We will.	0
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...	I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...	1
Naomi, I guess.	But you didn't hurt --	0
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."	Then why aren√≠t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?	0
Why not?	You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.	0
So why would PG&E offer it?	Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --	1
What's the sec...	Well - it's cold, Margie.	0
Aren't they great?	Your sister is an unbelievable cook.	1
How d'you mean?	Didn't you know?	0
He seemed harmless.	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?	1
Benjamin -- do they know you?	Thanks.	0
How'd you know that?	It's right there on your golf bag.	1
Jack, wait...	Just a second, that's all!	1
It doesn't bother me either.	<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.	0
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.	So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?	1
Yes?	Graham Dalton.	1
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.	I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.	1
Where do you want to do this?	I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --	0
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?	Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.	1
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.	Just...say...no!	0
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.	What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.	1
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?	Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...	0
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.	But I'm curious, Rose.	1
How old is your boy?	Four.	1
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.	Sid, you don't have to.	1
But I was with him the whole time.	The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.	0
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!	No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.	1
No.	How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.	0
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.	Jean Baptiste!	1
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?	For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.	1
They would have killed you too.	Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.	1
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.	No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.	0
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...	1
Only in the movies.	C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.	0
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.	Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--	0
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?	You're not the only one.	0
What's a revival tent?	To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.	0
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.	Get off me.	0
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.	Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?	1
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...	Carlos De Moraes?	1
Are you here?	I'm here.	1
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.	Archie.	1
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?	Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.	0
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?	Why?	0
This is exactly what I don't want.	Oughta make 'em happy.	0
Because I love you...	I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	0
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.	You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.	0
Perfect.	I don't know which ball's mine.	1
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...	1
I get it!	No.	0
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.	My God... did you get a look at who did it?	0
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.	Eight stories.	0
Permanent damage.	My daughter must be going nuts.	0
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.	A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.	0
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.	Me?	0
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?	How soon?	0
Does he always leave so early?	Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.	1
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?	Sweet.	0
Don't bother!	Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.	0
Do you like pink?	Very much.	1
What am I? The beer wench?	Is that right?	0
Whatever you say.	Cause she's dead.	0
Not directly anyhow ...	Smashing idea! Give it to me.	0
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.	Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?	0
A passionfruit smoothee.	Where's Jones?	0
...isn't it perfect!	It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.	0
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.	Yes, of course.	1
What?  How could he have?  When?	Paramount studios.	0
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....	It could have been an accident....	1
I know what I know.	Disease?	0
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.	1
It isn't?	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	0
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.	Live together.	0
So, like your father, you changed the rules...	Picked his pocket, actually.	0
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?	Harry.	1
I had no idea you were even here.	Maude???!	0
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.	Shut up!	0
Worse than Cairo?							*	Connie, don't hang up.	0
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.	I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.	0
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.	Sounds good.	1
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?	Of course.	1
Come on, let's give it a dry run.	It means a lot...that you came.	0
What if nobody stops for us?	Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.	1
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?	Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?	0
Is he really not here?	Yeah. RISC is good.	0
Is that all?	Why not?	0
Why don't you leave me alone?	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --	0
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!	But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...	0
Did you notice -- no cane?	I pray God grants it me.	0
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?	No.	0
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if√≥	-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?	0
Are you sure?	We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.	1
Sit down, Jake.	Where are they?	1
What?!	Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."	1
The zoo?	Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.	0
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!	What do that mean?	1
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?	Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]	1
Harry.	I'm no bodyguard.	1
Please don't...	And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...	1
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --	Say, Ni...	0
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.	Underwater?	1
But you will not... be safe...	Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?	1
Why the change? What about your work?	It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?	1
May I ask you a personal question?	...Yes.	1
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.	Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.	0
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.	Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...	0
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!	Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.	1
Thanks, Dad.	Nope. I think the man is a liar.	0
No.	How come?	1
...school's fine...	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?	1
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.	No. Not particularly.  How come?	0
No.	See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?	1
Do you have a name?	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.	0
What are you talking about?	Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.	0
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.	Like a woman of mystery.	0
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.	What's the matter?	1
You don't know.	No.	1
Alone tonight?	Every night.	1
Yes, it's great!	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...	0
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.	I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.	0
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?	You are extremely sexy.	0
I bet you have loyal customers.	You liked what I brung ya?	1
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...	You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.	0
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.	This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.	1
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.	Around.	0
Yes.	Ok.	0
You don't know what I'm thinking.	It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?	1
Wasn't that cowardice?	No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.	1
I thought you were going to bed?	I am.	1
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?	Why shouldn't she be?	1
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.	Aren't we all.	0
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.	Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?	0
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.	If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!	0
I haven't said anything of the sort.	But you would like to know where she is?	1
You will die! It will be awful!	I'm an idiot to have you up there.	0
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --	Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.	1
I like a place with lots of life.	...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.	0
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.	1
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?	0
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.	They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'	0
We're doing something -- ?	I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...	0
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.	Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.	0
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.	... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?	1
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	You share dreams?  That's incredible.	0
Is that one of the Who's Who?	No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--	1
I got to get home.	Take it where?	0
Unless you get caught.	So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.	1
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?	GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!	0
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.	Committee, huh?	0
Don't bother me, Norman.	It's not worth the risk.	1
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --	I'm not its master.	0
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.	You got a problem all right.	0
Says who?	You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.	1
It's been a while.	I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.	1
"We're" not over-reacting.	Could you watch Jango?	1
But what?	But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?	1
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.	If anyone can help, HE can.	1
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?	1
Tom?	Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.	1
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.	You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.	1
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.	"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."	0
-- especially one like this.	So am I, Eve.	0
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?	Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?	0
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?	In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.	1
So?	Uh ... we'll let you know.	1
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?	Like hell "wait."	0
Yes he did.	Where is he?	1
Honey --!	I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.	0
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...	1
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.	We were just studying.	1
Who?	No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!	0
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.	He's a polecat, dear.	1
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -	You jivin' me?	0
Not without Jamie.	Look.	1
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.	We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.	0
Someone's gonna see us.	That's just another part of the price to pay.	1
You have to go.  I mean it.	Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.	1
Did something happen to make you care about reality?	Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.	1
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.	She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...	0
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!	No!	1
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--	Oh, but this one is so simple.	1
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.	There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.	0
Who can we trust?	Ship's log.	0
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.	When?	1
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.	I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.	0
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?	I don't know.	0
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?	The Rex.	1
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.	Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.	1
Oh, Rocky!	Christ.	1
What are <u>you</u> looking at?	I don't know.	1
Hell...	I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.	1
I just hope this is still good up there.	baby, please, please --	0
I love you, Chuck.	Why not?	0
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?	That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.	0
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.	Okay.	1
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.	You won't have to.	1
You know your history.	She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?	0
My kids want me to teach them.	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!	1
Nick, please, it's me --	You told him about Nick's letters.	1
Sure I am. It's fun.	Mm. And your like, what else?	1
If you have to work...	Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?	0
I can't take this anymore.	I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.	1
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.	It was quite a page turner.	0
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.	All right. What's been going on?	1
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.	You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.	0
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .	Huh-huh. You?	0
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!	I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.	0
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --	Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.	1
Are you out of your mind?	I don√≠t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We√≠ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...	1
You're not ready.	I embroidered.	0
Who is it?	It's me.	1
Saw me --	Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.	0
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.	She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?	0
Maybe I've just got the creeps.	I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.	0
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?	Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.	0
Um-hmm.	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?	1
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!	No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.	1
You were scared, weren't you?	Get in the boat, Rose.	0
Yes, darling.	I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?	1
You don't understand shit.	I can believe that.	0
No, no.	I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.	1
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.	What?	0
Women aren't that unpredictable.	Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.	1
I just can.	I never knew a girl that could play.	1
No, we'll go through here.	If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.	0
Yes sir.	Jesus!	0
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.	Caps.	1
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.	Why?	1
It would be a nice change from you.	Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.	0
I'm nearly out.	It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.	1
Not personally.	A little longer for me.	0
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.	I wanted this to be a date.	1
Do you like the way I feel?	No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.	0
Well? What'd you think?	I just wanted to see how you looked.	1
Oh, yeah...	Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!	0
Well... the couch would be all right...	You can sleep on the bed if you want.	1
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.	The guy got sick and couldn't come in.	1
Geez, they look kinda weird.	Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.	0
Yeah?	Anything... just ask.	0
Jack!	We're leaving.	1
He told me.	And what did you say?	1
They seem to like the idea.	Bring the money in and they follow it?	1
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.	Can you describe it, Deanna?	1
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.	Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?	0
Aaron, will you tell me?	It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?	1
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.	Yeah.	0
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.	It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.	1
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...	We've been making progress, I see.	0
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.	This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?	1
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?	You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.	0
Could you?	Where to?	1
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.	Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.	0
Mm-hm.	Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.	1
No rain.	That you... you don't even know the guy.	0
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.	Wait, wait.  You told her about me?	1
You wanna go on a date with me?	Please, yes.	1
I think she'll like this very much.	Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.	1
Take care, wilya Johnny ?	See you on the bounce !	1
Uh oh --	Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --	1
I'm so glad.	What, darling?	0
Want to know what, exactly?	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.	0
So...	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?	1
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.	I know.	1
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.	Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...	1
It was nice having you "watch over me"...	Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.	0
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.	Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.	1
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...	I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.	0
Uh huh.	Dismiss the company.	0
No...	Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!	0
Yeah.  Real hot.	Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.	1
What a great kite.	I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?	1
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?	Was I?	0
Uh-huh.	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...	0
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.	There's someone in the house.	1
Please leave.	So-called?	0
You've always hated the animals.	Goodbye, David.	0
So, do you enjoy being an actor?	Oh sure. It's very rewarding...	1
It's vile.	Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.	1
I feel better. Do you?	Yeah, I do.	1
Great line.	Excuse me.	0
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.	I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.	1
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?	It's what I've learned.	1
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?	I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.	0
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.	Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.	1
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!	What?	0
But...who...	It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.	0
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.	1
Can you at least let me in?	Uh... sure... come in.	1
Why do you have to defend her?	You needn't use that language with me	0
Dictation.  You know...	Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --	1
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.	Then he didn't send you?	0
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.	...and your General?	0
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.	What?!  There's nothing here!	0
Looks like he missed ya.	Yeh, this time anyway.	1
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.	Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?	0
That is not what I'm --	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.	1
The Institute ... the funding ...	Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.	0
Well, thanks.	Mine too.	0
What?!	An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?	1
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.	It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.	0
I'm going inside.	I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt√≥ What more do you want?	0
And who says what is wrong.	As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?	0
A girl needs a little romancing before she -	Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!	1
I can't see you tonight.	Okay...	1
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.	0
Luis is a despicable twit.	Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.	1
Where?	You want to go ballistic?	1
Not exactly.	Were you asleep?	0
So?	So maybe this is my dynamite.	1
Scottie!	How does it work?	1
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?	Jesus!	1
It won't sell.	Why not?	1
My God. He's going after the nest.	I've told you.	0
You're in the Records Room.	I'm fine.	1
You can trust me completely.	Yeah, well...	0
Who?	To Caitlin!!	1
What?! No, no. You can√≠t--	I have to.  I√≠m the best man.	1
Think real hard, Benjamin.	I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?	1
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.	I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.	0
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!	Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.	1
I'll miss you, Mike.	Listen, I'll... see you again.	1
He called you right here.	I just talked to him.	1
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.	Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.	0
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.	But you're his friend.	1
I don't want to go there.	Do it my way.	1
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?	No.	1
Jack.	Please. Let√≠s just go have a cup of coffee. That√≠s all I√≠m asking for. I√≠m sure there√≠s another flight to Paris tonight.	1
Every guy has a type!	I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...	1
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.	By the way, how is your German?	0
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.	Looks like Tim Kobza.	1
I think it's like... inquisitive.	It was Henry Follett.	1
I'm going to miss you.	That's what you said the other night.	1
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --	I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.	1
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.	Nope. I think the man is a liar.	0
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?	Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?	0
Why?	Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?	0
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.	Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.	0
Yes!	And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?	1
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?	Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?	0
What!	And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.	0
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!	Okay.	1
I took a cab.	You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?	1
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -	Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.	0
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.	From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.	0
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...	It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.	0
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?	Last night? What do you mean?	0
Something else.	Okay. Promise?	1
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?	Because it's his bad luck to be special.	1
There are fucking coyotes out there.	Your hot-ass temper.	0
Oh, you --	And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.	1
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?	He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.	1
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?	What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!	0
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.	Oh come on!	1
Son?	Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.	1
She's not in an ambulance Father.	You are.	0
Well.  At wakes.	This is a little different.	1
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.	Wait a second. He knows I know.	0
STEPHANIE?	My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -	1
Do you think you're ready?	Hello, Alabama.	0
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.	We came back to the house!	0
You care about him, don't you?	We might as well pack.	0
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?	Yeah.  Got my own sign.	1
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--	What?	1
Jack.	Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.	0
Which ones?	All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.	1
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --	But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --	1
Just local, of course.	And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"	1
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.	Very well. Thank you.	0
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.	You said -	1
What?	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.	1
So you ever gonna do a picture?	Not you too	1
What?	I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.	1
Did you do that when you were a kid?	I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.	0
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.	I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--	1
Have you seen it?	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?	0
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?	Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.	1
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?	Sure.  I'll call the guy.	1
No.	Why?	0
Love me... keep me safe...	Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.	1
He was creepy.	Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.	1
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?	No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?	1
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.	OK.	1
He's in it with Willis?	Haven't you opened it?	0
You always say that -- then you leave.	Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --	1
And are they going to get it?	I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.	0
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.	It might have.	1
What are you going to do?	Well, all right.	0
You can be so immature!	Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?	0
Oh, yeah?	What's the matter?	0
Can I stay a bit longer?	Didn't I say that?	0
Ready?	Yeah.	1
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.	-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.	1
Aye --	Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?	1
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.	I don't follow you.	1
Hold that thought.	Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?	0
Hi, Dad.	One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.	0
Do you have to call me that?	I don't know your real name.	1
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?	Jesus, I don't believe it.	1
What rate?	You know what I'm talking about.	1
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.	Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.	0
No.	What would?	1
--Torn down in the name of convenience--	She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.	0
You say 'fuck' a lot.	Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.	0
More the merrier.	Do not.  Promise me.	0
The hell you call me?	Eh, if the bootie fits...	1
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.	Okay, OW!	0
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.	Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.	1
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.	Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?	1
I don't understand.	He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.	0
I changed my mind.	Yes, you do!	0
...There's a start for a meeting.	Yes to me or yes to the coil?	0
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.	I thought only action movies had villains like that.	1
Sometimes.	Sometimes which?	1
GET OUT!	Depends, who pays?	0
Go right ahead.	You remember.	0
Oh....Say something.	That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.	0
You are not threatening me anymore!	I'm not -	1
What?	Do you love your parents?	0
They mean it.	Who's they?	1
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride√≥	I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.	0
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.	She's right.	0
Forget it.	I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?	1
But... You may not be well enough.	I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.	1
No, I--	Well I do...	1
We just want --	You wouldn't understand.	0
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.	Following me?	1
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.	Carrie.	1
He was trying to kill you, right!	Why?  I don't know.	0
And this is Helen Carter.	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.	1
And you can't?	I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.	0
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!	Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.	1
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!	All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!	1
Her who?	Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-	1
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.	I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.	0
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.	Well, what's the matter?	1
What? What? What now?	I'm sorry but you're...	0
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.	Maybe I can help?	1
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.	Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.	1
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?	Um, yeah sure, I guess.	1
What's "nothing"?	Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."	1
Nick, what happened --	There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.	1
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.	Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!	0
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...	...<u>no</u>, they don't...	1
Yeah, what?	Good for you.	0
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.	Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?	0
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.	For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.	0
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?	This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...	0
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.	What do you actually know with religion?	0
What, Howard?	We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.	1
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.	Dad.	1
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?	Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.	0
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.	He taught all this to Swann?	1
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.	Okay.  I'll keep digging.	1
I'm just offering a place to stay.	I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.	1
Yes.	Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.	0
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.	Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.	0
...you wearing a watch, Father?	Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.	0
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?	What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.	0
Patrick Bateman's office.	Jean? Hello? Jean?	1
Fifty-seven.	I'll be up later.	1
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...	All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?	0
Oooohhhh.	Don't wake the kids...	1
Why?	The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.	1
But how are you going to escape?	Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.	1
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.	Sure, just give it back when you're done.	0
I've got patients coming in --	Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.	0
No. I haven't seen them.	Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?	0
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.	I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.	0
What happened to him?	He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.	1
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.	0
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.	Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --	1
NO.	Let's wait for some slow one.	1
You're lying.  I'm not human.	Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.	1
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?	Tell me I don't have something to do with it.	0
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.	There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.	1
He didn't mention a park.	How long will I live?  That no one can say.	0
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.	You don't actually do it that way?	0
It's not your house --	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?	0
Excuse me?	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--	1
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.	Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.	1
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...	...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...	1
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.	I warned you -- I get on a roll...	1
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?	It's alright.  It was a long time ago.	0
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!	...maybe I die for Nick...	1
One believes -√≥ it's like any other religion...	I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --	0
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.	Show me.	1
"In Washington..."	What?	1
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.	So now you suddenly care about my future?	1
Attraction is a complication?	It can be.	1
$250,000 right off the top.	I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.	0
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?	Are you busy on Friday?	0
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.	Your father?	1
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.	That's completely crazy.	0
What do you mean?	Isn't it obvious?	1
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?	A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.	1
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.	-- Listen to me --	1
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.	0
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.	How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.	1
Do you take sugar?	Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book	1
Not at all.  It was fascinating.	Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?	1
Cole, please stop.	She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.	1
Why don't you like me?	I do like you, Sheila.	1
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.	All right. This morning --	0
I'm always working.	But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?	1
I enjoy it.	Running your broker scam, you mean.	0
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?	Lovebirds.	1
Lloyd.	C'mon, just do it.	1
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.	Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.	1
What happened.	Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.	1
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!	I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.	1
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.	You mean coitus?	0
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.	What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?	1
Who is it?	Me. It's Eddie.	1
She took you shopping for a tie?	Why did he come out here? What's going on?	0
What? Really?	Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.	1
Find out.	Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.	1
Where?	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.	1
Who are you?	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.	1
I think it's not horrible.	I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.	1
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?	Distance from Reliant...	0
Quincy, please...	I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?	1
After he tried to shoot you?	He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.	1
Yeah.  Real hot.	No.  What's that?	0
It seems to have survived.	Play something, Grace.	1
A--flack jacket.	No, that's okay, I'll do It now.	0
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.	We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.	1
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.	1
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?	I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.	0
The point is, they want a man inside.	And if you do it wrong?	0
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.	This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.	1
Then why do you keep running away?	Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.	0
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?	I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.	0
When can I talk to you?	Baby, I'm in the middle of work.	1
I went out last night.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.	0
Who's Donna?	Donna?	1
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.	Then don't talk about killing.	1
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.	Because I know what it says.	0
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.	Me neither.	1
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?	Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!	0
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.	I'm not a stalker.	1
I can never get a way from it.	Old ties are hard to cut.	1
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...	Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.	1
Yes. I do.	Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.	0
Doing what?	Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.	1
You know Sid Fletcher?	Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --	0
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.	Okay.	0
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?	1
In that order?	No.	0
I said you were never a faggot.	Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.	1
I'm really sorry.	Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.	0
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?	You can't prove anything.	1
Oh, Paul--	So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.	0
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.	Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?	0
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?	I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.	1
You feel violated?	Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.	1
Why should I?	Bird. That's jazz.	0
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?	I don't have a title yet.	0
What <u>is</u> your problem?	And you accused her of tampering with your mail.	0
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?	Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!	1
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.	S'okay.  I know you still love me.	1
Did you see it come down?	Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.	1
Yeah.	I know you've only known me a short while.	1
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--	What's the matter, Mary?	1
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.	My wife.	0
Yep.	We'll let it run awhile	1
It must feel great.	I thought I did.	0
Kalen...	Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.	0
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!	Cheers.	1
A job for me?	I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.	1
I'm -- I'm with a friend.	And who is that?	1
Roseman Bridge?	That's it.	1
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?	Takes one to know one.	0
Where have you been?	I've been thinking--	1
How's the detective business?	That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.	0
He wants me to come to his quarters.	A shift change should come through the scheduling office.	1
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.	About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?	0
Who is it?	Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.	0
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--	That's in Maverick County.	1
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?	Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.	1
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...	That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.	1
Who are you?	Because he is trying to retire me.	0
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.	He didn't.	1
Rob.  Don't be childish.	No.  I missed that.	0
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --	Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.	0
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?	Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.	1
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!	Speaking.	0
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.	0
It's Lynn.	Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.	1
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!	Not exactly.	0
Enzo, why do you guys do this?	What else is there?	1
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?	0
Long ago...	Well, it isn't.	0
And? What are you saying?	I'm sorry.	0
Not yet.	Who's the other one?	1
You're up!  You must be feeling better --	I don't have a phone.	0
He's not, he's...	Yes Esther.	0
What's in Big Sur?	That's where Valentine's scarpered.	1
David?	You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.	0
The curse drove you to gather this?	You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!	0
-- very nice, very nice.	-- mmm --	1
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.	No, I'm fascinated.	1
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.	Oh.	1
When?	Tom.	0
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.	0
I am running faster!!	Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.	0
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?	Thank you.	0
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.	I know.  I taped it.	1
His name is Oscar.	Oscar!  You poor kid!	1
Is that a promise, then?	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.	1
It's just as I thought.	Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?	0
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.	0
Harvard. Law school.	You got into Harvard Law?	1
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.	What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --	1
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.	I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.	1
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.	I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.	0
Jack is dead!	MacFarlane	0
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.	1
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?	Yes, it is.	1
Yes.	You asleep?	0
Catherine Tramell.	She said what you said she'd say.	1
Daddy you scared me!	No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?	0
What about the car?	What?  You're not going to wait for me?	0
I'm sure.	She was a revelation...	1
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.	I've been doing good, though.	1
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.	You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.	0
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.	Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.	1
Who's that?	He didn't. Get over it.	0
Not because of Ned.	Don't talk about Elaine?	0
Easy, now.	<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.	0
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.	Okay...	1
Dave.	I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.	0
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.	Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!	1
What? This?	Yes -- I believe you do.	0
Why?	Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.	1
What am I going to do with you?	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.	1
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.	It's not your fault.	1
Well, then, you must come back and visit.	I know it's none of my business --	0
That sonofabitch!	Yes.	0
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?	Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.	0
I mean porno movies.	Well... mostly...	1
Ben?	Same one you were reading the other night?	0
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .	Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.	0
Sounds like singin'.	No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.	0
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.	Miss me?	0
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.	"...for my father."	0
Paul, this will be our legacy.	Yes. Please. I want you to.	0
Jack...don√≠t even start...	Look, you don√≠t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...	1
It's my mother.	Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!	0
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.	Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.	1
Don't start --	Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?	0
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.	I'm sure picking up on vices.	0
I only have something like sixteen weeks.	Sixteen weeks is a long time.	1
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...	The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-	1
Mommy's sick, guys.	What brings you out to these parts?	0
Mmm, what?	Right.	0
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.	Just keep your eyes on the road.	0
What crisis?	How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?	0
What?...WHAT!?	I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...	1
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?	Say hello to your mother.	0
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.	A little longer for me.	0
What is this, a game?	I want to hear it from you.	1
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.	Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.	1
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.	1
No. I'll do them later.	No. I found it.	0
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...	Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.	1
Yes.  I am.	In that case... no...	1
Where are you going?	You wouldn't?	0
I know.	Maybe.	0
A flare?	From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.	1
No! I look ridiculous!	Come out! I can do alterations.	1
Michael Myers.	She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-	0
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?	You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?	1
I had no idea you were even here.	I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.	1
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!	How about if I set the table?	0
Even your play.	Oh	1
Instantaneous.	Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.	0
I don't see why not.	But what if---it wasn't real?	1
What's being photographed?	The activities of nocturnal animals.	1
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.	I'm not even supposed to be here today!	1
Something for burns.	Ephedrine hydrochloride.	1
You don't like it?	It's okay. For restaurants.	1
Morning, darling.	Morning.	1
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.	Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.	0
I will. How's Shelly?	Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...	1
Yes, I did.	What the hell just happened?	0
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like...	Can we talk?	0
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!	They'll come anyway. They love me here.	1
Let me go home.	No.	1
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --	We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.	0
Twenty-eight.	I'm twenty-seven.	1
Bobo, no, I --	You don't think he's mixed up in -	0
What do you do?  What are you doing here?	Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.	1
What makes you ask?	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.	0
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?	Yes, we will.	1
To shave your chest?	Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...	0
In Europe.	About what?	0
Uh-huh.	If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?	1
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.	Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.	0
You still care about me?	Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.	0
To what?	I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --	1
Ya say we're acrost?	Look, Ma!	1
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.	I should probably write that down.	1
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.	It's the kid's lucky day.	1
Yeah, I know.	No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.	0
What do you want me to do.	The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...	1
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.	They killed Casy first.	1
All right, but...	Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.	0
Well...	I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...	1
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.	I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!	0
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.	They're like demons, Jez.	1
Don't be silly. Of course you can.	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?	0
He... didn't have me..  I told you-	Hi, Charlie.	0
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.	Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.	1
Is she...alright?	I thought she was dead. For sure.	1
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.	I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.	1
Basically, yeah.	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.	1
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...	0
What?	She is not your birth mother, is she?	1
I can imagine.	Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.	1
No--	You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.	1
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .	To the Black Pearl.	0
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...	Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.	0
That's not hard to do.	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.	0
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -	- - a gizzard - -	1
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.	That's Carlotta Valdes.	1
Who's dead?	My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--	1
You have somebody else out there?	We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--	1
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.	Bye.	1
Sail?	Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.	0
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.	Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.	1
A distinction worth noting ...	And here I am...	1
Find out anything?	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.	1
I can't do this --	What are you so afraid of?	1
Mark...	Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.	0
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.	Gordon Liddy, you mean?	1
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.	We have a daughter.	0
I have to tell you something...	That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.	0
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!	1
Well... goodnight.	Oh, yes, you have!	0
I told you what happened in Rome!	Do you expect me to believe...?	1
What... what are these interviews about?	You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .	0
But Richard, no, I, I --	Uh huh.	0
You're here.	OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?	1
Three months.	Yep.	0
C'mon, are you or aren't you?	Gee, this is great.	1
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.	She's all right.	1
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?	Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.	0
You always say that -- then you leave.	They killed him. They threw him out that window.	0
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.	Go home, Sheila.	0
Oh. What happens now?	Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --	0
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.	I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--	1
In a way.	Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.	0
Come on, Z.	So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.	0
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.	...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...	0
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.	Because I'm done.	0
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.	1
They must work on the section gang.	Are you serious?	0
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?	I had training. In the Republic.	1
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.	1
You asked me to dine with you tonight.	Yes?	1
Do you really want this, Dick?	This.  Above all.	1
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.	Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.	0
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.	So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.	1
All the same killer?	Low calls him Suspect Zero.	1
Oh?	The charades.	1
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.	He fixes the cable?	1
I would try for them.	You barely know them.	1
Santa Rosa?	Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.	0
Thank you.  But who sits there?	My brother's wife.	1
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.	We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?	0
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.	Oh, I would love to hear it.	0
All right, y'all gonna go with me?	We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?	0
What is.	You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.	1
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...	I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...	1
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.	Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.	1
Lamar --	All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?	1
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.	You thought my father was crazy?	0
You're kidding.	Bunch of savages in this town.	1
These are yours.	Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.	1
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?	You're at Paul Owen s.	0
That's ridiculous.	All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.	0
Is that all right with you?	Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.	1
So what's he doing? You believe him?	He wanted more than that.	0
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.	Doesn't the isolation bother you?	1
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?	It's okay -- I'll sit here.	0
Is that what you used to do?	My days are not the old days, genius.	1
Nothing.	Looks like rain, Steed...	0
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.	I am their hero!	1
You got a bet on the game tonight?	As a matter of fact, I do.	1
What?	Uh oh...	0
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?	I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.	0
Amazing.	How come you didn't catch your bus?	0
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.	You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?	1
Four thousand.	Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.	1
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.	How's your arm?	0
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.	I'll see what I can do.	1
...Don't you drink?	I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.	1
What do you mean?	A what?	0
I want you to get rid of Sailor.	I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!	0
You sure?	It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.	1
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.	1
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.	His wife changed the channel.	0
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.	Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.	1
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.	I'm used to paying my own bills.	1
Caesar, this is crazy.	Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.	0
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.	An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...	0
Which one is me? The horse?	That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.	0
Oh, all right.	You didn't jump in.	0
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.	I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?	1
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.	Do whatever they tell you--	1
Okay, so that's it.	Okay?	0
Thank you, sir.	And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?	1
I said, I've seen it before.	Alright.	1
Did she break your heart?	Something like that.	1
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.	1
Is it finished?	Me?	0
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...	In other words.	1
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.	Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.	0
Kill him. I'll pay you.	What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.	1
Who?	Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...	1
No.	What?	0
Who?	I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?	0
And who says what is wrong.	And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.	1
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.	Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.	0
We're just feeling our way back.	"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."	1
For the same reason you did, to help.	Yeah, let's go.	1
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...	Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!	0
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?	Tell me about yourself.	0
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?	Yes.	0
And that made you feel better?	And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.	1
And the bad news?	Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.	1
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.	Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.	1
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...	You have to shave? Like an ape?	1
Come on, get ready. It's important.	Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.	1
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.	I don't know.	0
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?	Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.	1
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?	No.	1
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.	It's an experiment.	0
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?	Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?	1
Where will you live?	It's better that way.	0
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.	Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.	0
No!... No!	Of course.	0
Well, put it down and come in!	You bet, hon!	1
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.	No, I'm look --	1
I see.	I run him off.	0
So you think time travel is possible? For people?	Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.	1
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.	Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.	0
What is this place?	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --	0
No. But he needs treatment.	It's a huge moment in their life --	0
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.	Yeah. That's love.	0
What?	What, what?	1
I don't see where we are *with* it.	No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?	1
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.	Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.	1
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.	That's a lie...	1
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.	I'm just preoccupied.	1
You've never said that before.	I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.	1
I get the picture.	Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.	1
...No... never in so many words...	What are you talking about? Who's Janet?	0
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.	That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.	0
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.	Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.	0
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.	No.  Nobody but you.	0
Sidney's father?	In 76 years, me neither.	0
I haven't felt like it.	Let me take you out tonight.	0
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.	-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --	0
What do you want to know?	The good stuff.	1
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.	--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.	0
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?	Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.	1
You could pick that scab on your arm.	No trouble.	0
Is it? Is it really?	Of course, my dear. What can I do?	0
A lady threw it to me.	Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.	1
What?	Exactly my point	0
What a man!	Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.	1
The Matrix isn't real!	Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.	1
Go ahead.	What's going to happen when you release the whales?	1
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?	Yeah.	1
No.	Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?	1
And certainly pretty.	Yes.	1
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.	So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?	1
Look, John√≥what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a√≥	Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but√≥there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.	1
NO!!	But they did take place?	1
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.	I am not a thief...	1
No.	And...?	0
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.	Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!	1
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--	Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.	1
Brother and sister still?	I wish to be your husband.	1
No you're not.	Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!	1
Maybe so...	You don't actually do it that way?	0
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.	Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.	1
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?	Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.	0
Yes Walter.	All about me...	1
I don't like her.	I do, she's real funny.	1
He's dead.	Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.	1
Can I help you?	Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.	0
You really think I look sexy in this smock?	Is that a yes?	1
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.	How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?	1
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.	0
And that's a bad thing?	I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.	1
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.	Just one minute....	1
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!	But I can't --	1
Who says?	The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.	0
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...	He gives a good report and I walk?	1
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.	Oh, Sally Mae...	1
Well, if it's all the same to you--	I know. It's--Violet.	1
Intestines.	Yeah! Them.	1
I am sleepy.	I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.	1
Not at all.	Where's our friend?	1
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.	Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --	1
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?	Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?	0
Yes.	We'll cover it later.	0
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.	Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...	1
Back to California	My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.	1
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.	Something wrong?	0
And "Frank?"	"Frank" was my mother's father.	1
Are you alright?	Yeah.	0
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.	And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?	1
You liked it there.	Yeah...you a witch?	0
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.	Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.	0
Fine.  How's your back?	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?	0
Can we turn the light on?	Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?	0
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?	I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.	0
I'm only trying to...	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---	0
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.	Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.	1
That's fine.	But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --	1
I tried to tell you...I tried....	That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.	0
Hello, Benjamin.	Oh. Hello. Hello.	1
Is this the Community Hospital?	Mm-hm.	0
God, if Chet found out he'd...	Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.	1
No.	Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.	1
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.	Then riding together.	0
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.	Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.	0
Here they are.	You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.	1
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?	1
I've been trying to find you all day.	Talking's good, walking's better.	0
What about her? Would you go out with her?	I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...	1
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.	Why, you ungrateful brat!	1
It was a she.	Don't ruin this for me.	0
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.	But you were such good <i>friends...</i>	0
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.	What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.	0
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.	There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.	1
We're going right ahead with--*what*?	Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...	1
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...	Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -√≥ I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her √≥√≥ to see her √≥√≥ to touch her √≥√≥ in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.	0
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --	All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.	0
Alright?	Not all that pasta.	1
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.	And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?	0
I want to thank you.	I've gotten to know someone who's famous.	0
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?	You sure you really want to?	0
What did he look like?	The bogyman!	1
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --	I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.	0
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.	Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!	1
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?	I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.	0
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.	Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.	1
She looks just like you.	Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.	1
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"	Oh. Nothing... Sitting.	0
Oh? Anything I might have seen?	Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.	0
You don't ever think about other people?	No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.	1
Daniel.  Listen --	I'm having one now.	0
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?	What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.	0
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.	These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.	1
Father, I have sinned...	Let's get out of here.	0
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.	Then don't talk about killing.	0
And... where are things?	Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.	1
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.	My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...	0
You mean like pedal pushers?	I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --	0
-- instead of what he is --	No.	0
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?	Was he swallowed?	1
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.	I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.	1
What?!!	I haven't any hard feelings.	1
What does that mean?	Read it.	0
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.	We don't have time to argue about it!	1
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.	I think she's pretty, Mommy.	1
I don't know.	You hope this, too?	0
Really?	Yeah.	1
I thought you had a girlfriend.	Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?	1
Love...	Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.	0
The Fountainhead.	Great book.	1
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.	You got me, peanut.	0
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.	Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?	1
You and the Colonel go back.	Maybe. She's OK.	0
This is where we are.	Is there enough room?	1
You're lying. I don't believe you.	Then don't come.	1
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.	1
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.	He give me your address.	1
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.	0
It just isn't.	Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.	1
Well, the studio told me not to.	I must go to England -- at once.	0
Hello!	Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?	0
No.  You just looked as if you did.	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.	0
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?	Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.	0
Why?	What do you mean "why"?	1
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.	H'm?	1
Another satisfied client?	If I don√≠t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden√≠s Tower, M is dead.	0
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?	Life can be beautiful!	0
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?	You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.	1
What will I say when she comes to the door?	You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?	1
Did you see my father?	No.	1
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.	1
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.	It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.	1
Stepmother.	... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.	1
James...	And you think it's worth all this?	0
They're gonna hafta take their chances.	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.	1
I'm not positive... but... he knows.	Hello.	0
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?	She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.	0
Which side are you with?	I'm with Terry.	1
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.	Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!	0
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!	Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.	0
Well--I am Madame Colet.	And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.	1
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.	What?	0
You said you didn't trust it.	I don't.	1
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.	Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.	0
Rub it on the windows!	And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!	0
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".	Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.	0
Goodbye.	Goodbye.	1
Why can't I stay with you?	It's not possible right now.	1
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.	I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?	1
We can refuse to talk.	What's wrong with your son, anyway?	0
What?	Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?	0
Let's forget that we ever met.	I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...	1
When??	Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.	0
What are you doing?	Nothing.	1
What?	This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?	1
Some kind of circuitry...?	Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.	0
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.	Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.	1
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.	What's in Florida?	1
Ben where do you have to get to?	Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.	0
Tell me.	In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....	0
Yes, I have. I will.	Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.	1
Oh good.	Why not?	0
Never...	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.	0
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.	Did you love him?	0
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?	Yes.	1
Who are you!  Who are you!	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.	1
No, I'm going home.	Why? It's not dinner time yet.	1
Hi.	Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.	0
Nepal? Have you been?	Why?	0
Do you think the rabbit did it?	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.	1
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.	To his hotel?	1
Go ahead.	I should've danced with you.	1
No, Lester.	I don't want to.	0
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!	Meaning?	0
Before what?	Before Bill came to Hollywood.	1
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.	I know.	1
It didn't bite me.	I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.	1
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.	So tell Calvin.	0
I happen to work for the police god dammit!	I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.	0
No you don't.	If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?	1
Huh?	I can read it to you.	1
Which could maybe what?	Well, since you're a member, we could...	0
That's the end of the line.	Then I know my alphabet.	1
Up yours.	So you're just attracted to me, is that it?	0
You don't have to say that.	I never say anything I have to.	1
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.	Wander about.	0
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?	Shut up, Violet.	0
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?	Yeah, I guess.	1
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--	But not nice enough to marry--eh?	1
That's what I said.	I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?	0
How's the food?	Got it.	0
At least they weren't lit.	I hate this fucking place.	1
You're not serious.	I'm always serious.	1
...I'm sorry.	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.	1
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.	Do any pupils come to the house?	0
No? Then what?	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	0
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?	Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?	1
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...	If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.	1
Do you still have that doctor's number?	Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--	1
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.	So this break... is a break-up.	1
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.	1
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.	Okay.	0
Two of us might be more effective than one.	They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.	0
Who is that other guy?	Another contractor.	1
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.	I wanted to call.  I couldn't.	1
What's it about?	About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....	1
What is this?	Magic potion.  You should try a little.	1
Yes, you do.	No, I don't.	1
You don't have to...	I'm glad it was me.	0
No!	What's this all about?	1
...T-thank you.	Do me another favor?	1
I didn't like Preysing right off.	Then why did you have anything to do with him?	1
Just like you would be.	Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.	1
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.	She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day√≥whether it's coming to her or not.	0
Aaagh! Rape!	Oh, thanks.	1
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...	That makes it worse.	0
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?	After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?	1
I'm engaged for the evening.	Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?	1
What?	What friends?	0
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.	Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.	1
So, when can we do it?	One of my few virtues is discretion.	0
Daddy, what's the matter?	Nothing.  I'm sorry.	1
Paul, this will be our legacy.	It will.	1
I'm so sorry.	Quaint? Can't imagine why.	0
What are those things?	I don't know...	1
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?	Father?	0
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.	How could I stay away?	0
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.	You said it was in the rolltop desk!	1
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.	He was just on the phone.	0
You've lived with me for two years.	That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.	1
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.	6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?	1
Maybe it's the satellite.	Thank you.	0
You mean it?	Victims of what?	0
That is the most unprofessional --	Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?	1
Hello.	I'll take it out of their skulls.	0
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.	1
I'm coming in.	I don't want you to!	1
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!	Frances, I'm warning you...	1
Are you afraid?	No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?	0
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.	Got a nice evening dress?	0
Why are you doing this?	Because I want to.	1
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.	The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...	0
I guess she's not in here.	That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.	1
The King pipeline.	...Do you really want me to forget about you?	0
I see.	If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.	1
I just don't want to go over it any more.	I didn't know what was on it.	0
Scottie, Scottie...	Let's waste him.  No offense.	0
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.	0
I told you, George. I'm not going.	Sure you are.	1
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.	I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...	0
Hello!	I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.	1
It pays.	So do day jobs.	1
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.	It's inside a moving car.	0
Yes it was all you --	Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --	1
Keep your voice down.	Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?	0
The curse drove you to gather this?	Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.	1
What did I say?	You asked me if I would --	1
I love you.	You're forgetting you're married.	1
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.	You caught that, huh?	0
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --	--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.	1
I need more pressure in the shark tank.	Okay.	1
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?	Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!	0
That man is your father.	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.	0
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...	0
Calls himself Dodd.	Would you marry me if I was?	0
What?	Last night --	1
Attic space.	Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.	1
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.	0
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?	No, thank you.  Goodnight.	1
And your wife? Where's she?	She's dead.	1
...Huh?	You know, on farm route 17.	1
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?	Just one?	0
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?	What?	0
You're looking for life?	They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.	1
Do you? Oh do you, darling?	Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.	0
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...	0
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.	Running your broker scam, you mean.	0
It's three years old, it --	Bring it to the other location.	1
... Do you think we should look for him?	I don't.	0
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.	Yo, I'm not comfortable either.	0
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.	Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...	1
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!	It can't be true!	1
In the South Wing.	Does it have a name?	1
Can't I just go with you guys?	Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.	1
I don't think so.	Why are you smiling?	1
Dewey?	I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.	0
Well, have you ever made love high?	Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.	1
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.	I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.	1
Fuck Kurt.	Nice-looking kid.	0
I'm trying to play with your body!	I'm just tired in general.	0
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?	Don't ask me.	1
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...	I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.	1
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.	Yes.	0
You know what I'm going to be?	A cowboy.	1
I don't think so.	Yeah.  It was.	0
He's gone.	I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.	0
No!	And that's what you've heard?	0
What was that all about?	Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!	0
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.	"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."	1
I know.  I go with you.	Even the swallows are back.	0
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.	You'll get over that.	0
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?	I did more then that.	0
Epps, over.	No thanks.	0
What's this?	Just some sketches.	1
I'll be up in five minutes.	Well -- goodbye then --	1
You think I manifested the snakes?	Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.	0
You're not going to hit me?	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.	0
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.	Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.	1
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.	You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.	1
Where's Bruce?	Then come with me.	0
He's not ready yet.	When?	1
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.	Yeah... that's all it is.	1
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --	You said --	0
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?	You thought that?	1
But why is he doing it?	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.	1
You want me to move?	Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.	1
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...	Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?	0
Ours.	It's Jerry's worst idea.	1
No.	Yeah, just stay where you is...	0
Well the other night at dinner...	Oh that, she just likes to play.	1
You're looking well.	Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.	1
...So?	No trouble at all, really.	0
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --	Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.	0
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.	That's my cousin, Angelo.	1
Modelling.	Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.	1
How 'bout a back rub?	Picked his pocket, actually.	0
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."	Hello.	0
It's everybody's problem!	Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.	1
I want to know why you are the way you are!	And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.	1
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.	1
That would be one point of view.	But that one time --	0
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?	<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--	0
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.	From whom?	1
No. Why?	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --	0
What does that mean?	Why?	0
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.	Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...	0
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?	Well... the red bra.	1
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.	You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.	0
He asked how you are.	And you said?	1
Reverend Edwards.	Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?	1
She's too upset.	What about?	1
French?	Listen--can't you wait till we get home?	0
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!	Oh--Saunders--	1
He's trying to impress you.	He's doing a good job.	1
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?	Yes, I am, Norma.	1
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.	You've got to help me, Hildy.	0
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?	Try lookin' at it from this angle	0
Really?	Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.	1
Loud.	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.	0
What's that?	We killed him.	0
I took a loan on my car and my computer.	You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?	1
Yes.	These are your initials, 'K.C.'?	1
It needn't be; not if you've another story.	No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?	0
Is that the technical description of what I've got?	Is she against you getting help?	1
What am I injecting you with?	Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.	1
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.	Actually, I am, though.	1
You can't use that until Neo is out!	Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.	0
No.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.	0
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.	It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?	0
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?	Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.	0
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?	I, uh.	0
Why are you doing this?	Because I'm in love with you.	1
I made it go down the toilet.	What?	1
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!	You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?	1
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!	1
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.	That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.	0
What are you talking about?	You must.	0
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.	I think we should go.	1
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.	Well, I don't.	1
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?	"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.	0
Oh --	Hey, I'm, you know --	0
My medication.  I left it back there.	What John Doe?	0
Don't you trust me?	Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.	1
No.	Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.	0
You know, the moment is rather dying here.	Hold on... I know I have it...	1
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...	To kill me.	1
I guess.	No you mustn't, my child.	0
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.	No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.	0
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.	Bit messy.	0
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.	You up for that?	0
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?	Come on.	0
This feels stupid.	Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.	1
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.	With who?	1
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.	Can hardly wait to do it again.	0
How?	You never disappointed me.	1
I'm sure.	So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.	0
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!	I'm going home Cynthia.	1
No, sir. This is my own idea.	No way, Jude. I'm out.	0
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.	Are you always sucha good judge of character?	1
You must've had a reason to ask me that.	I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.	0
That was just so... awful!	A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?	0
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?	She finds him "personable."	0
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.	We?	1
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?	No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...	1
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.	That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.	1
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?	I don't want to be alone.	0
No, that's okay.	Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.	1
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?	Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?	0
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?	Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --	1
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?	No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.	1
Ohhhh!	And what's that mean?	0
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.	I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!	1
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?	Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.	1
On screen...	"Frank" was my mother's father.	0
They didn't give you a choice, did they?	No, they didn't.	1
Yes.	Three times, then two times.	1
So it's like you want to be secret friends.	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --	1
When did you start smoking?	I don't smoke?	1
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.	All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!	1
That makes it okay?	They stole our land--	1
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.	A mistake?  That was no mistake.	0
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.	That's the plan.  My word on it.	1
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.	It's all over the place, everyone knows.	0
Not leftovers?	No -- real food.	1
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.	Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!	1
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.	Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.	1
You could have a pool to cool off in.	Sure.	0
So, it's from the future, is that right?	One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.	1
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.	I'm all tied up.  I can't.	1
What the crap?	Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.	0
What do you want, Senator?	The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?	0
How'd you get this number?	Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.	0
Please.	We did this before.	1
Jack.	I don't think that's such a good idea.	0
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!	You in a hurry?	0
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.	Thanks for the vote of confidence.	1
What are you going to do?	Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.	1
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.	Try.	1
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.	1
No.	Don't get too cocky.	0
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!	Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.	0
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!	No.	1
Will you?	Let me think about it, O.K.?	1
You were saying...	No.	0
Sure... What's Grace up to?	Riding with Judith.	1
I have several jobs.	What do you do?	1
Hi, Joey.	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.	1
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...	What if you're not here tomorrow?	0
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.	I don't want to place you in any position --	1
Like what?	Oh, wait, Maude. Look!	0
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.	Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?	0
Kids? What about them?	No.	0
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.	Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?	1
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.	I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --	0
And that's the only reason?	Can you think of a better one?	1
Can I read it?	He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.	1
Let's just be sure.	I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --	1
Tell me about her again.	We'll be all right...  We will...	0
Forgive me, I didn't know.	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.	1
Yeah.	Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.	1
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...	And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.	0
Hon?	You sure?	0
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.	Who?	1
You finish the reading for E-con?	What's the problem, Molly?	0
Well... yes, sir, there are.	These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.	1
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.	Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?	1
Okay?	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --	0
I'm so very sad.	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?	1
You know what?	What?	1
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...	Knock it off. You're not mad.	0
Johnny, wait...	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.	1
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.	Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?	1
I'm so tired...	You can sleep tomorrow... come on...	1
What's your new book called?	I don't have a title yet.	1
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!	Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.	1
I have friends.	They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.	0
What happened to them?	That's okay too.	0
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?	1
Why?	You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.	1
Yes.	Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!	0
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!	Saunders--!	1
Don't be evasive.	Margo, you haven't got any age.	1
Never to put you in my will.	Really? Why?	1
I live here, remember?	Right on the flight line?	1
My imagination isn't that good.	I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.	0
Have you got a minute?	Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?	1
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.	Easy come, easy go.	1
Uh-huh.	I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.	1
Yeah?	I think you should wear that.	1
Because, growing up, books were my world.	Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.	0
So you'll call me, right?	Well, now you have.	0
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.	I'm sorry.	1
Where'd you come from?	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.	1
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.	Now, Fran --	0
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?	Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!	0
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.	1
Sunlight... It destroys him.	Sunlight?	1
No doubt.	Ellie...	1
Have you known him long?	Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.	1
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!	All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.	1
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?	I don't want to talk about it.	1
You are well?	Gabe.	0
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.	I wasn't about to.	1
What is it?	Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.	0
Still a bit chilly ...	Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.	0
Aren't the kids asleep?	Every year.	1
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.	The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.	1
I have to talk to you.	We are talking...	1
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."	What's wrong with your son, anyway?	1
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?	...Babe the Blue Ox?	0
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.	Huh?	0
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.	Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.	0
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.	How'd he die?	1
You're a little too fast.	Can't you understand me?	1
Thanks, Dad.	Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?	1
You're --	Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.	1
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?	Perfect.	1
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.	What?	0
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now √≥ the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.	Um... can dad come this time?	0
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.	I finished it.	1
Fumitsu.	Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.	1
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.	I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --	1
Are you going to kiss me?	It's not my back that's killing me.	1
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.	0
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...	I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.	0
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...	Your grammy!	0
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.	Good.	1
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?	No.	1
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.	Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!	1
A month from today?	Yeah.	1
Ours.	No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.	0
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.	The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.	0
It's early yet.	It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?	1
Thank you.	Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.	1
Oh, no, I have a car.	You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?	1
That's nice. Are you drunk?	I don't know. How do I know?	1
I told her she was going to meet her father.	What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?	0
Gabriel!	A man of some travels.	1
Get ready to go.	Believe me, I am.	1
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?	It was a gift... from my brother.	1
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!	I do. I want to very badly.	0
Oh -- Okay.	No.	0
Stay away...!	No-I can't take the time off work.	0
Hing, hang, hung.	Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.	0
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...	Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.	0
That's your sister school, right?	Sort of.	1
Yeah.	Get on the truck, Tatiana.	0
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?	Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.	0
I've got troubles.	I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.	1
Then you'll die.	But you were such good <i>friends...</i>	0
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.	Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.	1
Amazing.	Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.	1
No, no.	You can.	0
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.	Really?	1
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.	Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.	0
And they won't be able to tell?	I love you.	0
And you thought I√≠d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?	I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...	0
Burned out.  I need a vacation.	Okay--I mean--	0
But Kirk...	No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.	0
How do you that.	Sure.	0
What will we talk about?	He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?	0
Yes.	Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!	1
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.	I might not be able to.	1
[Beat] You bled to death.	What?	1
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?	That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--	1
It's crossed my mind from time to time.	And...?	1
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?	0
Why?	Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.	0
So why isn't it all bloody?	I assume he licked it clean.	1
Oh, him.	She's dead.	0
No Juliet?!	it will be all right, madam.	1
Michael...	What have you discovered?	0
Check this out.	Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.	1
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.	You bitch. I knew it.	0
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.	Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.	0
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...	I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.	1
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...	Lily!	0
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.	Really?...	0
Curse?	What is it if it ain't a curse?	1
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.	Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.	1
I'd never do that.	Get married?	1
My gosh, Norman.	Yeah, it was awful.	1
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.	No, wait...	0
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?	No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.	0
A what?	No, it's not... Come here...	0
You lied.	I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...	1
That's cool.	Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.	0
I can't afford this stuff right now.	Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.	1
That must be it.	Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.	0
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!	And you saw them happen?	1
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!	Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?	1
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.	Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.	0
Really? Well, let it rip.	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.	0
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.	Hmm.	0
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?	0
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I√≠m a coward.	I think you√≠re one of the bravest people I√≠ve ever met.	1
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.	You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-	0
Deep breaths --	Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.	1
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.	Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?	0
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.	Did he put you up to this?	1
Charlie...	...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.	1
What?	Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.	1
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or√≥ or human kindness in your whole body.	No.	0
Oh... Well.	The car broke down.	1
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.	Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.	1
I can't go out like this.	It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.	0
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.	Am I getting warm?	0
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.	You have a headache?	1
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---	What?	0
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.	What are you doing?	0
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.	Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...	0
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.	Like she smelled it too?	1
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...	Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.	1
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?	Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.	0
...Well, that passed.	Yah?	1
...I'm going to kiss you.	Mathilda, stop, please!	1
For everyone.	Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...	1
Are you supposed to be here?	I've got you worried, haven't I?	1
Dick, I can't even breathe here...	Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!	1
I wish they'd put us in the same room.	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.	1
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.	They're not going to jail.	1
... I will.	I guess he didn't.	0
I'd better go in.	That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.	0
It's my day off.	But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?	1
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?	Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?	1
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.	That's Rache's song!	0
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!	What?  Jesus, tell me!	1
We don't have a relationship.	I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.	0
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...	Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.	0
I don't believe you.	I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.	1
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --	Honestly ... no.	0
Your qu...?  But you're...	This is funny.	0
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.	Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.	1
Yes. I do.	And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?	1
Cheap, cheap, cheap.	Well, that's the point, stupid.	0
Frank!	Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?	0
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.	I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice √≥√≥ that's it, isn't it?	0
Are you in love with her?	- in the gods - Huh?	0
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.	Usually.	0
Um-hum ...	That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.	0
Jon, no -- I can't --	Quite a send-off, isn't it?	0
Oh, yeah...	You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...	1
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.	Absolutely sure.	0
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.	1
Your share.	It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.	0
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!	If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!	1
Hi.	Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....	0
What difference does it make?	A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.	1
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?	I should like to smoke.	1
She was not as beautiful.	No, she was not as beautiful.	1
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.	Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.	1
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.	God, I never thought of that.	1
I'll give notice.	Try not to sweat?	0
Yeah.	Okay, but that doesn't excuse his √±	0
What month?	You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.	0
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.	1
We killed them, didn't we?	Of course.	1
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.	What are you talking about?	1
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.	He's not a man, he's a god.	1
Can't sleep?	In and out.	1
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.	He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.	1
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.	As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.	0
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.	0
I know.	Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.	0
Yeah?	No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.	0
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.	I understand completely.	1
Dysfunctional --	That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --	1
Oh.	How long you been married?	1
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.	Thanks.	0
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.	She told you that?	0
What is it Miles?	I want... I want to...	1
Just come with me!	Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.	1
Rogers Hornsby?!?	Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.	0
In Birmingham.	Oh yeah? That's my home town.	1
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.	Wander about.	0
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.	Sure.	1
Thank you.	Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.	0
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...	They're not.	0
Are you a writer too?	Me too.	0
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.	Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.	0
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.	You always been this stubborn?	1
Fifty-seven.	We can't stay here.	0
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.	No, this is me in a nutshell.	1
This is Lena.	Hi.	1
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?	Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.	0
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?	I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!	0
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.	A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.	1
Could it be intelligent?	No--I mean--yes--that is--	0
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?	Yeah.	1
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.	0
Why didn't you?	You can't expect me to explain that to you.	1
Did it ever bother you?	Did it ever bother James Bond?	1
What?	I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --	0
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.	Okay.	1
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.	Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.	1
Now look what you did!	It wasn't intentional.	0
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.	Like cancer with a purpose.	1
I want you to take this... to remember by.	Where's my baggy pants?	1
No more, Lenny.	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.	1
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.	1
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.	Aw, shucks, ma'am...	0
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --	The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.	1
I've been ok.	Good. How's your mom?	1
Really.  What'll I pin this on?	Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.	1
Mary Had A Little Lamb.	Ah. A classic...	1
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?	A... I gotta go.	1
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?	0
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.	I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?	1
No way.	One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.	1
I moved the couch. That's all.	What could have done this?	0
What did you think of the music?	Extremely clever.	1
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.	Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.	0
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.	Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.	1
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --	Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --	1
You said things would be fine, and they're not.	I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --	1
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.	Depends, who pays?	1
You know this?	That depends.	0
She answered our prayers.	Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.	1
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?	She'll forget about us eventually.	1
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.	If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?	1
You're so sweet.	Yes,... I see.	0
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.	Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.	0
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.	No, they're for your mom.	0
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...	She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.	0
Father Barry.	Because it's comfortable.	0
Really?	Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.	1
What are you talking about?	Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.	1
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...	Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.	1
Sure.	I didn't know that.	1
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?	Because, I'll take it.	0
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?	You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.	0
You got a point there.	People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.	1
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.	Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.	0
What am I going to do with you?	Go.	0
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.	You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?	0
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'	Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.	0
HOW MUCH TIME?	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!	1
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.	1
Aren't they great?	Marylin! Listen to me.	0
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.	It must of been a convincing letter.	1
... You're very perceptive.	Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.	0
You just haven't met the right person.	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?	0
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.	That's because I am the shark.	1
Oh, now I'll never get home!	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.	1
Yes.	Oh no.  Not at all.	0
What was she like?	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...	1
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!	You really care for him, don't you, Eve?	1
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.	... Damn!	1
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.	What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.	0
I... yes.	Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.	0
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?	So I was replaced by Mitch?	0
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.	There's nothing to know, Ann.	1
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?	Yes...	1
You mean, he might be hiding there?	I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.	1
I thought we'd have a few more days.	For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?	1
Got anyplace special in mind?	We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.	1
With Trina.	I want... I want to...	0
Go!	All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.	1
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.	Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.	1
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.	Erin --	0
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.	'Bout what?	0
Mind if I sit down?	I miss her. I miss my wife.	0
Just do it.	Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.	0
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.	Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.	1
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...	Half-brother to be precise.	0
That's easy enough.	I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!	0
How did she die?  I wanna know.	You don't wanna know.	1
I do believe you...	Until a minute ago.	0
Did you find your father?	Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.	1
The future guy?	I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.	0
We're...	You're the dead.	1
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?	Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?	1
It needs blood?	It isn't?	0
No.  It's a Christmas present.	I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.	0
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.	You want a punch in the mouth?	1
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...	1
Cole slaw, ice tea?	A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?	0
You didn't know?	That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...	0
What?! No, no. You can√≠t--	Sure, Gino, sure.	0
Oh... You mean you don't want to.	Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?	1
Oh, yeah...	Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.	0
Home.	What?	0
I had a good time tonight.	What'd he say?	0
You've always hated the animals.	You've always loved the animals.	1
I don't know.  Cancer, I--	Could ya take off that hat.	0
What happened?	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?	1
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.	NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?	0
But my sleeping is really fucked up.	I don't think I've slept in a year.	1
What's that?	You won't die, Rose.	0
Escape hatch.	I've told you.	0
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	1
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?	You bet.	0
What's wrong, Norman?	Right.	0
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me√≥ who?  -- who?	I wish I knew, Edie, But√≥	1
Excuse me?	Get out	1
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?	No.	0
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --	It's easy for you to be patient.	1
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.	What do you mean?	1
I'm not using him as an excuse.	Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.	1
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.	I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.	1
Yeah.	I don't know.	0
Is anything missing?	No.	1
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...	So do you.	0
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!	Well...	0
Santos... I can't...	You leave something out?	0
Can I pour you one?	Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.	1
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.	1
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.	Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?	1
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?	Sure.	1
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!	No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer√≥	0
He'll need clothes... some money...	Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?	1
Hi.	Yes.	0
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?	Yeah.	0
Am I fucking him?	You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.	0
No.	Do you always say 'no' to everything?	1
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.	I'll be right up.	1
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...	I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...	1
No.	It's my birthday.	0
-- is that what this is all about?	Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --	1
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.	That's yes?	1
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.	No.  But I wanted to.	0
Look, we don√≠t have time for this right now, we√≠ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You√≠re not wearing that to the Thompsons√≠ party. I don√≠t care how hilarious you think it is...	I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...	0
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos√à knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.	Meaning...?	1
What happened? Did you cut yourself?	Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.	1
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.	In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?	1
You did all this for me?	I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --	0
It's private.	You want to tell me...	1
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.	Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.	1
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...	Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!	1
Much.	Then feel better!..	1
Because you always obey orders ...	Always.  Except ...	1
I like plaits.	You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.	1
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?	If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?	0
Let me get the light.	No.	1
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?	<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?	1
...yes...	Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.	0
Groom.	Yes, dear.	1
I'm scared.	So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.	1
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.	Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.	0
Don't you want to come along, darling?	You don't want the police any more than I do.	0
But you did it anyway.	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.	0
Her who?	My friends?	0
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter√≥and stick by it?	You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?	0
Yes.	I want you here.	0
Maybe I'll tell you later.	You sold him out.	0
Well it's nice that you were there for her.	I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...	1
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...	You are.	0
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger	0
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!	You are the Princess.	1
What else?	It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.	0
What?	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.	0
Could you do somethin' for me?	Finished!	0
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.	0
We had a seance.	How could I stay away?	0
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.	Come on--let's take a swim.	1
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.	I'm allergic to it.	0
How's the detective business?	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.	1
Wrong answer --	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?	0
Sure.  For five bucks.	I guess in case one year they're not.	0
Sure. Why not?	Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.	1
What happened to your house?	Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.	1
Did it work?	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.	1
Sure plenty of times.	How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.	0
I should leave.	I got them all, Mother.	0
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?	I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.	1
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.	A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...	0
What size?	Eight.  Size eight.	1
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.	I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.	1
What?  What is it?	Woody!  Buzz!	1
Why did you come back?	Yes. It is.	0
M'I gonna see you tonight?	That's right.	1
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?	No.	0
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?	So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.	0
Are you going down?	I don't know.	1
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!	All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?	1
'kay.	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --	1
Now I become custody of police department?	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.	1
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.	Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.	0
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?	I'm choking on it.	1
And what did he come back now for?	Who?	1
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.	Hello.	0
You've read The Fountainhead?	Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...	0
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.	How?  How could they have gotten anything?	1
I'm walking.	Talking's good, walking's better.	1
Koessler doesn't know any of this?	I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.	1
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.	No.	1
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.	What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?	1
Oh, no.	What?	1
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.	Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.	0
You can open your eyes now.	Let me heal you, baby.	0
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?	- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?	0
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--	--my number one fan.	1
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.	-- stop --	1
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.	...What?	1
Just ask me what you want to know.	Oh, you gonna make me say it.	1
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.	What?	1
Steve?	Whatever his name is, that actor.	1
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.	Absolutely not.	1
I did.	A single hour.	1
The kids take me.	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...	0
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.	A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.	0
Look, I gotta get some sleep.	I've been craving that stuff all week.	0
I just can't believe it.	You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.	1
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.	I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.	1
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?	I want that shark, Kathryn.	0
Real genuine guy.	He's good at what he does.	1
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.	Why would she be hiding from me?	1
Nah.	How can you help us?	0
So what's wrong?	Nothing, nothing at all.	1
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.	You expect me to believe that?	0
I think...it...works.	Let me show you the entire trousseau!	1
No luck?	Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.	0
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.	How long have you been back?	1
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.	~Don't shoot, G-Men..."	1
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?	No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.	0
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.	1
No.	I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--	1
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.	Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...	1
We think so.	Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.	1
Is there a part for me?	No, my flag steward.	0
I got married.	"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?	0
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.	Yah.	0
Damn it, Ben --	This is good. Little hints of clove.	0
And so you did your job, right?	Yes, mam...	1
Well! You don't say!	It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.	1
How!	It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--	1
To what?	Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.	0
Not yet.	Don't talk about Elaine?	0
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	No.  I'm missing the game for you.	0
It's my first cigarette in over a year.	The first is always the best.	1
What have you done with him?	I put him to bed.  He's not there?	1
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?	0
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.	I was not.	0
To you?	No, not to me, for me, for the camera.	1
He does this every year?	It's the worst job since keymaster.	1
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.	Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.	1
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.	Wow. That must've taken some courage.	1
It's been a while.	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.	0
Hi.	Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.	0
What do you think?	I don't want to bore you.	0
I want to be a teacher.	A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.	1
Much happier.	All right.	1
No, Stamp. I ain't.	Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.	0
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.	0
What happened?--Was Meurice there?	Yeah.	1
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.	The two might go together.	1
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?	I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.	1
Go around him.	There's not enough room.	1
You can't be late.	Santos' place.	0
What?	It's making me hungry.	1
I've heard some foolish things in my life.	Harry is coming to pick me up.	1
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?	Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.	1
But ... you did it before!  Last time --	Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.	1
You can't make me stop caring...	She's cheating on him.	0
We're taking a flight?	A stimulant.	0
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....	Hitch-hiking.	0
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!	Why... yes.	0
To see Dad?	It's in your closet.	0
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.	Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?	1
What business?	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.	0
What are you doing? You can√≠t. I...	Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.	0
Pritchett: what is going on?	He must've unsealed the room!	1
Guess you gotta go.	You're the best.	1
That's probably good.	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.	0
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.	Shells?  Whatever for?	1
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --	This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --	1
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.	Oh no. He said that.	0
It seems highly intelligent to me.	What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.	1
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.	Come on in.	0
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.	Woof.	1
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.	Your entire body?	1
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?	Um, yeah -- thanks.	1
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!	Let us go, miss.	1
Nothing is going on with us, is it?	Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...	0
Seen a lot of islands?	What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.	0
Is everything ok?	Yes.	1
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.	That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.	0
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.	They don't have that kind of potential.	1
Nobody.	But who were they?	1
What kind of personal project?	Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.	1
Okay. See you around.	Um... did you still want to read my novel?	1
I read your book.	Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?	0
Like me.	No. Not like you.	1
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.	Can I buy you another drink?	1
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.	It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.	1
That's a good one, coming from you.	Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.	1
Hi.	Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.	1
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?	I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?	1
What else?	Nothing else.	1
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.	...All right, Eve.  If you say so.	1
Drew, you're out of line.	Where you married?	0
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?	I bet you can.	0
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.	0
Do you?	Hi.	0
Not one of Steven's finer moments.	Oh. You know him.	1
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.	It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.	1
This is one big house for one single person.	Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet.	1
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.	I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.	0
Great saints!	No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.	0
Honey, what happened?	You won't.	0
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.	You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.	1
Well, what do you wanna talk about!	Nope.	0
They said you'd be here.	What's up?	1
Where'd you say the showers√≥and things√≥were?	Hey√≥you're little, aren't you?	1
But.	Hush, baby.	1
Is it December?	Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.	0
Do you have a better idea?	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.	0
There were some shots.	What're you talking about?	1
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.	I'm part of the game, just like you.	1
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?	No!!!	1
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?	Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.	0
How long do we have to watch him?	Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.	1
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?	It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.	0
Where?	Outside Adele's.	1
What about Jeremiah?	Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.	0
Just one arm!	Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.	1
Hello.	No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --	0
So?	Why not?	0
Huh?	I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...	1
The next corner we can get a cab.	I should be committed.	1
And this gives worth to butchery?	We√≠re alright.	0
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.	Why should I believe you?	1
Hey.	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--	0
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.	Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.	1
Michael Meyers.	The serial killer?	1
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.	You can sleep on the bed if you want.	0
A page-break signal.  A period.	Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.	0
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.	I can't believe I slept.	0
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.	She was going to leave you anyway -	1
Who was that?	Nobody.	1
-- You remember.	You getting into bed to think about yellow?	0
It's not going to well?	... acts like she's thirty-five.	0
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.	That's a good question.	0
You pull me up.	He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.	0
I... I know that, John...	You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....	1
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?	I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.	0
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	What... you mean "got into bed with" them?	1
You're wrong to sell Ich short.	He drinks.	1
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?	But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.	0
Big spender.	I know what junk is.	0
You sure you can manage?	Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.	0
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.	But why, Claudia?... Why?	0
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.	That is not true. They have tried to help me.	0
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.	Alright.	0
Why do we always stay here?	Plan to.	0
You mean - like frigid?	It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.	1
I was at home.	And I never heard of Sanctuary.	0
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.	I'm sure.	0
Don't you want to hear about my day?	Yeah let's hear about your day.	1
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.	No, I mean doing it at my house.	1
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?	I was the Warden?	0
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.	1
He's nothing like you.	I don't even know if you're my girl.	1
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--	Chaos.	1
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.	I'm supposed to call in.	0
So what was all this -- some sort of test?	Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.	1
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.	Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.	0
Is this the wish of the masses?	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.	0
Is it? Is it really?	Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.	1
We can be real quiet...	I love that you're my wife.	1
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.	What... Bo-... What about the magazine?	1
Hair stuff?	Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --	0
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.	That's why I wear a target on my chest.	0
How did you know my name was Sarah?	You told me.	1
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.	Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?	0
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.	1
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?	It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.	0
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-	Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.	1
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.	And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?	1
- - barfs them up - -	- - and swallows fresh ones.	1
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.	Can you move over a wee bit?	1
No, I don't think so.	You don't believe me?	0
Nick?	Hello.	0
Is he alright?  What happened?	Goin' to see my kid.	0
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.	So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?	0
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.	You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.	0
I got seared.	What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?	0
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.	Well, I'm a puppeteer...	1
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.	Judy --	0
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.	Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?	1
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.	Forget it.	1
What happened?	Where is he?	1
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...	Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.	0
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!	Shut up, Violet!	0
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.	Me?	1
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.	All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.	1
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?	Forty-one pages.	0
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.	Did I ever talk about the accident?	1
Nick - I won't have you going down there.	Oh...I came close once.	0
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.	Certainly!	0
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?	1
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?	And you, sir? Any better?	0
Like you could find one	I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.	0
Come with us.	But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...	0
Whose orders were those?	Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.	0
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?	Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.	1
That wasn't in there before.	We must've had it delivered then.	1
No, I don't, I don't.	Unknown.	0
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.	Amen to that.	1
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...	So?	1
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?	Uh huh...	1
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.	Really, why's that?	1
Why not?	Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.	0
My readings indicate great instability.	We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!	1
You're married.	What do you think?	0
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.	I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.	1
Lucy overdosed.	How do you figure?	0
Now can I tell?	What about O-2?	0
He knows that?  Billy?	No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.	0
How can you be so casual??!	Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.	0
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!	Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.	0
Do you think she's prettier than I?	Yeah.	0
Why?	I feel sorry for him.	1
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.	Hello, Hildy!	1
I don't believe it.	I'm afraid it's true.	1
I'm sorry.	Tubab means white man.	0
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.	There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.	1
They don't believe me.	Try.	0
What's he doing out there?	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.	1
What did he say?	I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.	0
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.	Come here. Come on, now.	0
I had sold my fucking soul.	I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.	1
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--	I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.	1
Your general appearance is not distasteful.	Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?	0
I can't go any farther.	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.	1
Who?	The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.	1
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?	Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.	1
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?	Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?	1
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.	I'll say she is!	0
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.	I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.	1
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.	That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?	1
There's nobody here. Jason...	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.	1
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.	FUCK LOGIC!!	0
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...	If I marry you my mother will die.	0
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.	0
Honey.  Let's go.	Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.	0
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.	Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.	1
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.	Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"	1
WHAT?	I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?	1
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.	I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...	0
This is where we are.	Who?	0
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?	I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.	1
I am told so.	I dunno.	0
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.	Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?	0
But you were pulling your hips last night.	But really, you never know.	0
A Chigro?	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	1
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?	Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!	0
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.	1
No.	Where?	1
Yes, sir.	Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I√≠d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...	0
Monsieur Rick, I --	-- He's just a lucky guy.	1
What will you do when the money runs out?	It won't. Are you ready?	1
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.	You know each other?	0
Promise?	Which you have in mind.	0
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.	You mean she's dead?	0
Are you?	That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?	1
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.	I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --	1
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?	A little less than yesterday.	1
Just Johnny.	Stupid yourself.	1
It's the last thing we need.	Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?	0
I'm fine.	Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.	0
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.	1
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?	That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.	0
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.	Yeah?	0
Any other vices?	All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.	1
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.	That what you think?	1
You won't of missed much.	Yes.	0
Would you settle for pepperoni?	Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.	0
I don't get you.	I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?	0
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!	I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!	1
You were in hell?	I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.	0
...What?	And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?	0
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.	Beth --	0
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?	It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.	0
Where?	It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.	1
I just want to understand--	That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.	0
Are you all right?	Are you listening to a word I'm saying?	0
What happens if they don't do that?	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.	0
When?	Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?	0
What do you know about it?	Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.	1
So the chest is still out there somewhere.	Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?	0
I may spill something.	You've always loved the animals.	0
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.	It's very interesting.	1
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.	Simple.	1
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!	Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.	0
Are we goin' home, John?	Ssh...	1
I would if I knew where I was taking him.	Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!	0
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.	Oh, I had the radio on.	1
No!	Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?	1
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?	Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!	0
What?--	I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --	0
Yeah, but I don't like it.	Why not?	1
Margo hasn't done badly by it.	You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.	0
Make it my first born.	Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...	0
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.	That must have made you proud.	1
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --	I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.	0
You know.	You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.	0
Pull out your cock.	What?	1
What am I wanted for?	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...	1
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?	Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.	0
This is it, then.	What?	1
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...	Never mind.	0
But why would they murder...	Because √± somehow √± they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.	1
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.	Isn't that ridiculous?	0
There's something wrong with this picture.	Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.	0
I don't think we survived the crash.	This is going to take some time.	1
I think so... What about you?	Me? Sure. Why?	1
Honey?	Yeah, baby.	1
No...what?	I could get promoted right out of here.	1
Darling!	You know what I mean.	0
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.	My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.	0
I'm trying to be your friend.	No, Starla! No!	0
You need a COAT!	Ash, you've gotten me enough --	1
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."	On the side!!	0
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.	Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?	0
We still have you and I.	I'm sorry I woke you up.	0
Yes...	Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?	1
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.	1
You, please.	Me?	1
On your first time --	I'm just looking.	0
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.	We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.	1
THX!	Thanks, but you have a good time.	0
What will happen if I do?	Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.	1
You're trusting.	What have you discovered?	0
Right now.	Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.	1
he's just playing, Q...	You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?	1
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?	Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.	1
Aren't you Nick Charles?	Mother and Father said so... you know?	0
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.	Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...	1
Hauser?  You're Hauser.	I agree.	0
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?	I'd be honored.	1
How. Did you. Know that?	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.	1
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.	1
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.	What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?	0
Oz, it's okay, I know.	You called me Oz.	1
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.	Cover...our footsteps...	0
I'm going back to the institute.	How do you mean?	0
I can't.	I know. I'm sorry...	1
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...	Jump in.	0
I'm not much on rear window ethics.	That I am very little different from him.	0
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.	Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?	0
My daddy likes me home before dark.	It's good to listen to your daddy.	1
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?	0
I've seen him.	You have?	1
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.	1
Cheap, cheap, cheap.	They smell.	1
Do something.	What?	1
Well, they're a good outfit.	Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.	0
What are you doing here?	Please.	0
Do you understand what I said?	That's right.	0
Yes, you are. You're very sick.	No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!	1
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?	Both.	1
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.	And you agreed?	1
Yes -- he mentioned it.	So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.	1
Wait?	Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?	1
"I actually feel good about myself?"	What did you find?	0
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.	But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.	0
I'm babbling.	No, you're not.	1
I'd love one, but not there.	We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.	1
Our decision. Together.	Your decision. For us.	1
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.	Shan't happen again.	0
-- why?	-- these bastards have me hemmed in.	1
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.	He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...	1
What is he doing?	So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?	0
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?	Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.	0
This feels stupid.	Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.	0
Who's that?	That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.	1
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.	Yeah?	0
Well--I am Madame Colet.	What?  No I'm not.	0
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."	What?	0
That's not even a scam.	What's a scam?	1
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.	A what?	1
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.	ok.	0
You look nice. I should have dressed.	Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?	0
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.	I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.	0
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.	Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.	0
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?	That is a skill!	1
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.	Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.	0
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --	Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --	1
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....	My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.	1
Oh, yes.	Insolent young cub!	1
Mike?  Our Mike?	-- OK --	0
Shouldn't you answer that?	Not now. We need air, not greetings!	1
How?	I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...	1
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -	I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -	1
Hello?	Hi.  It's Frank.	1
You mean the time you're locked away?	No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.	1
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?	You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.	0
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.	I left like an hour ago.	0
Who were you talking to?	Sixpack...	1
The point is, they want a man inside.	And I thought you were a bright woman.	1
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?	Do you love your parents?	1
The alarm clock.	You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.	0
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..	Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.	0
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.	So what made you think it was?	1
Most natural thing in the world!	I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--	1
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."	"Go Get 'Em, Honey."	1
I wouldn't do it.	Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --	0
Don't go in, Ryan.	Jeez, that thing... Can't you...	0
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.	When are you coming home?	1
Like what... my favorite color... ?	It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.	0
So. Not bored yet?	Don't ask.	0
Guess that makes you pretty special.	You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.	0
It gets worse.	No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.	1
What do you think it is?	I have no idea.	1
So the guy's not a sicko.	If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.	1
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?	The very same.	1
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...	New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.	0
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--	Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.	0
I know.	Will you make love with me?	1
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?	It's pretty.	1
Let me get you a cup?	Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.	0
Do you swear you didn't know?	I swear.	1
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.	I'll take you with me.	0
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?	I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.	1
May I ask you a personal question?	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.	0
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!	They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.	0
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.	1
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.	Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?	1
Did you come home during the day last week?	No.	1
I'm so glad.	I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?	1
What are you saying?	Then forget it.	0
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.	Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.	1
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?	I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.	1
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?	You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?	0
What's going on?	We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.	1
I can't tell you, Theo.	I know my treasure.	0
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.	You talk to him?	1
You think she's gonna make it?	Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.	1
Shoot.	Depends one which one.	0
...Where'd you get the pistol?	At the gettin' place.	1
They all consider me just as one of the boys.	Right!	1
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.	-- What could he have done to warrant that?	1
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.	0
Get the presents and do the lights.	Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.	0
I don't know if I can.	Still playing?	0
I just don't think it would work.	Why wouldn't it?	1
Ow.	When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.	0
You're nothing but a... a...	The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.	1
I don't wan to discuss work.	Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.	1
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?	That tall, bright building.  Near there.	0
I asked first.	Sometimes I think I do.	1
Screw you, asswipe!	Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?	1
Yes.	"For"...?	0
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.	You share dreams?  That's incredible.	0
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.	1
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.	You earned it.	1
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.	No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.	0
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.	0
Seventy-five.	Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.	1
She left the fucking gate open.	Good -- that's what I was trying to project.	0
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?	You use words like that, you might make me mad.	0
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.	Would you like to accompany me to dinner?	0
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?	Bracelets.	0
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --	-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --	1
What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know... Jackie?	1
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.	Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.	0
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?	Lady.  you've got the wrong man.	0
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --	I do.	1
I have.	Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...	0
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.	That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.	0
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!	Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.	0
You're done worse.	I'll be scarred for life.	1
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.	No. I'd feel stupid.	0
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.	I wasn't sure if you'd make it.	0
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!	Usually.	0
Can I take off my clothes now?	No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.	1
Can you show me?	Small moves, Captain, small moves.	1
Hey!  That's my boss!	Tomorrow.	0
Okay.	No.	0
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.	No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.	0
Why?	The same thing.	0
Good-bye.	Good-bye.	1
I didn't mean that.	I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.	1
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.	A business meeting, I told you that.	0
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.	You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?	1
Oh, that explains everything.	I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.	1
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?	Only one way to find out.	0
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.	They know you are Tutsi!	0
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.	Myra, I'm not following this.	0
What?	Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.	1
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.	Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.	1
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --	Yes. I would like to escort Eve.	0
You went out with her?	Not really.	1
You gain weight?	Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.	1
A new magazine! I never saw it before.	Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.	1
Is it dark?	What about Ian?	0
No, he can't.	Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?	1
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --	1
Hmmm... I vonder vich.	Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.	1
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.	If she wants me, she can come to me.	1
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.	I am a professional man.	0
Don't be scared, Walter.	Daniel Burdon, FBI.	0
Your bookie?	No.	1
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.	Did you give her the money?	1
What do you like to drink?	I'm a fiend for mojitas.	1
Then come with me.	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?	1
Henry.  Wake up.	A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.	0
This... how long did this attack go on for?	Seconds.  Three, four.	1
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.	When I go off?	1
How?	I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?	1
Hi.	Yes.	0
This could be it!	Father's friend.	0
But attractive--	Is that what they're calling him?	0
Well, what're you going to do?	I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.	1
No?	No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.	1
I see you're still having problems with your openings.	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .	0
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.	Look at you!	1
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.	It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.	1
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.	You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.	1
Could you do me a favour?	Yeah, I'll do you a favour.	1
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.	The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.	0
It√≠s called character. God, you√≠re predictable.	Is that why you brought him? Because of me.	1
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.	...Why didn't he close the window?	0
And what do you think you might have said?	I think I might've said I was in love with you.	1
I thought you were getting me a drink?	Just a minute.	1
What?	That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.	1
What?	She is not your birth mother, is she?	0
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...	Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.	0
For what?	We're about to be shown the way.	1
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?	Red Rum.	0
Try Wednesday.	Everybody take five.	0
It's your money. You talk.	I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.	1
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--	No, no.	0
No, never!	When I go off?	0
On his back, I suppose.	No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.	1
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...	They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.	0
Travis, you haven't even played the record?	We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.	0
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.	What --	1
Why would I do that?	Lois, someday --	0
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.	I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.	0
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.	Yes please!	1
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.	1
I know him too.	Oh, I had the radio on.	0
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.	Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?	1
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.	What's your real name?	1
Oh, thank you!	Depends, who pays?	0
No.	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --	0
You fell in love with her first.	Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.	1
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!	Can't fool around -- You look very great.	0
Who was it?	Kirsty.	1
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.	I never carry...baggage.	0
...you want us to go to War with Albania.	Oh, that's nice.	0
Why not?	Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.	1
It could make weather!	Laurie!  Good to see you.	0
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?	Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.	0
What dam?	The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.	1
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...	Why don't you just move out to Portchester?	1
I'm not.	So why go to college?	1
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.	Loved?	0
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.	I'm sorry. Really... I am.	1
Too young or too old?	To him.	0
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.	I don't want them now.	1
Let me go home.	Maybe that's okay.	0
Yes.	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?	0
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?	I had a temper.	1
Colwyn ...	Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.	0
Here you are.	Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.	0
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.	I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.	0
He'll barely be able to sit up.	I don't know.	0
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.	Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.	0
M'sieu Laval!	But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.	1
Honey, what happened?	I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.	1
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.	No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.	0
It's not a knock.	It's not a compliment.	1
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.	Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.	1
Well... is it so urgent?	If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.	1
Well -- do you want to go up first?	Yes -- I think that would be good.	1
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.	Highly suspect.	1
It's a crime.	I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.	0
Uh-huh.	That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.	0
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.	1
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.	I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .	1
Thank you, kind sir.	A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.	1
The Police, then...	Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...	1
Are you okay?	Hear, hear...	0
That was before I met one, of course.	Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.	1
What's he like?	Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.	0
Hola..	Oh, do you?	0
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.	I hate it too.	1
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.	I know.	0
You have to say that.	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.	0
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.	1
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?	No.	1
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.	I wasn't sure if you'd make it.	1
But what did he see that made him panic?	What do you think he saw?	1
Ted, what's wrong?	Ask Simon.	1
I'm okay.	Nuh-huh ...	0
What are you doing?	I didn't realise.	0
Okay.	All right?	1
Somebody better get down there!	What?!	0
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --	Yes.	0
Home sweet home.	It's nice.	1
Other than me.	Why would I--	1
I don't know.	Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.	0
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...	We got this far.	1
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.	It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.	1
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.	Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.	0
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.	Shut the fuck up!	1
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.	Hey, business is business.	1
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?	You're crazy baby.  I love you.	1
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --	Can I come in?	0
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.	Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.	0
Something else.	I don't know. My mind wanders.	0
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?	1
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?	Kept us warm for twelve years.	0
So why's he do it?	I guess in case one year they're not.	1
Thank you, Sergeant Major.	You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...	0
Liar!	Rheya.	0
Well, where is it? I-	No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-	1
I did. Are you?	Yes.	1
Date?	Yeah.	1
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.	1
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.	Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.	1
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.	Here!	1
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.	Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?	0
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.	Okay.	1
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...	Really?	1
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.	How prominent?	1
Been here long?	The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.	0
But it's what we want.	Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.	0
I didn't say that I would run... I just...	I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.	0
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.	Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.	0
Look how far we've come.	You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.	1
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.	I don't think it's negative five.	0
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?	0
You actually forgot our anniversary.	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.	0
Yes.	INADEQUATE!	0
To make it easier for them or you?	Like who?	0
Well...	No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.	1
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.	...I can't beat him.	0
What's the matter?	Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.	1
Fuck that.	Don't curse in front of it.	1
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.	Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.	0
I don't want them to arrest you.	It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..	1
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?	Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.	1
Ray--	Fair enough.	0
I think he's running for town crier next year.	I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...	1
What?	Kept us warm for twelve years.	0
If you say so.	Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --	0
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?	And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.	1
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.	I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.	0
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.	What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...	1
What d'ya got in there?	My whole world.	1
Neat, yeah.	You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.	0
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...	No, never.	0
M'hm.	There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.	1
Do you understand German?	Keep firing!	0
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.	You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.	0
Murphy kid turn you down?	Yah?	0
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.	It's going to get worse, honey.	1
The money?  The money's gone.	No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.	1
No, why should I? It's yours.	It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?	1
I shouldn't have asked you to come.	You're crazy! You can't do that!	0
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?	He's alive!	0
Oh, gosh.	We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.	0
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.	The profanity bothers you?	1
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?	There's nothing crazy about that, is there?	0
Finished your estimate?	I'm sorry about what happened.	0
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.	No!	0
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.	Sure.	1
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...	0
I think it went on rather too long.	You heard me.	0
Hey, we can become blood brothers.	That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.	0
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?	I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.	0
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?	Certain wishes do.	0
Yes, what?	I would like to.	0
The dishes are juiced up, too.	Okay, okay.	0
We're engaged.	Sid?	0
Don't start --	Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...	1
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!	We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!	1
Stop asking everyone.	You look good--	0
Well, where are you --	Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.	0
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?	I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.	1
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.	I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?	0
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.	1
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.	But not nice enough to marry--eh?	0
Please wait till my husband gets home.	When is he coming back?	1
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.	I'm fine.	0
You met people.	He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?	0
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.	Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.	1
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?	Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?	0
I'm sure you haven't any.	For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.	1
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...	I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-	1
Everything has it's drawbacks.	Where did your brother escape from?	1
Who?	Cameron. You remember Cameron.	1
Did you tell her?	Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?	0
Come on, Z.	Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".	1
Tell them to go!	Sssh. What is it? Tell me.	1
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.	Karl is a guy guy?	1
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.	You're... quitting?	1
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?	Yes no not really.	1
Where we going?	Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!	0
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...	Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-	1
What? I... I wasn't saying...	It's a novel.	0
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.	One consolation; you can never be lonesome.	1
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.	So don't marry him.	0
What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.	1
Shut the fuck up.	I'm trying to help, Linda --	1
I feel kind of light-headed . . .	Don't worry, I've got you.	1
Well what?	Sure.  Bases Loaded.	0
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?	I have work, I can't leave.	0
Well...How have you been?	Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.	1
No.	How'd you manage that, then.	0
There's a million birds here.	In that birch tree is a nest.	1
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.	But if someone miniaturized the process...	0
I told her she was going to meet her father.	You what?	1
Honey, please.	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!	1
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.	0
Uh, what are those boxes?	I'm going to the store. You need anything?	1
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --	Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --	1
Are you challenging me?	Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.	0
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...	0
He's setting me up to make a proposition.	Opening night?	0
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.	Let's ditch this place and party.	1
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?	In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.	1
No. God no.	Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.	0
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.	No, not for that one.	1
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?	I thought I was in...prison again.	1
Yes.	Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.	1
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.	I'll try.	0
Looks old.	Older than me.	1
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.	Why, you sweet kid.	1
Yeah.	I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.	0
I don't.	I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.	0
How many?	You have more in common than you know.	0
Do you mind putting out the light?	Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.	0
No. What had you better--?	Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?	1
About my daughter?	Tomorrow morning.	0
Train. It took eight hours.	Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?	0
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.	Maude.	0
What's your real name?	Ok.	0
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.	I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.	1
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.	1
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-	Let me kiss you.	0
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.	1
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?	Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.	1
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...	Relax. I know what you meant.	1
Why did you kill my mother?	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.	0
No!	I do.	0
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.	No. You don't.	1
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.	Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.	0
Jesus Christ, is she for real?	Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.	1
"It?"	You're lucky. They kill as well.	0
Did you like the first act?	I - I'd really rather not...	0
OK.	Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.	0
Four door?	Two.	1
I don't know...	Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?	0
What about you?	I'll look around and catch up later.	1
You working?	Yeah. On the section gang.	1
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.	0
Congratulations.	You've got to admit it would be a novelty.	0
That's called changing your mind.	Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.	0
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?	Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.	0
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--	It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.	0
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?	Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.	1
Who is it?	Hide the car.	0
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.	Yes, of course, -- money!	0
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.	He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...	1
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?	Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?	0
Yes.	But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.	0
You look adorable.	Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!	0
Now who's being sarcastic?	Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!	0
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --	-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?	1
Those are priceless sculptures.	I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!	1
The accident...?	But then you've been so much better...	1
No.	Why not? It's three AM.	1
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.	It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?	0
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.	And?	0
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.	"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."	0
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Yeah, almost...	0
Is it safe for them here?	Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.	0
Oh, Matt . . .	I don't know.	0
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.	Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.	0
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.	Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.	1
I ought to call the police right now!	No.	1
Can't you give it to me later?	Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.	1
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--	What do you know about them?	1
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.	All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.	1
What are you doing?	You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.	0
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!	Yah, I guess.	1
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--	I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.	1
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".	I know.	1
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?	That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!	0
What do you mean?	Fine.	0
Are you sure this is a real dance?	Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.	0
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.	Hello, Dennis.	1
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.	Why?	0
What class sub does your nephew run?	C-class.	1
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?	What taxi driver?	1
Unless she has nerve.	I care about my daughter.	0
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.	You know I'm a good person.	1
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.	He's a great doctor -- a great man --	1
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.	Try Barney Clark.	1
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?	I believe I said I'd be tempted.	0
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.	You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?	0
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?	Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.	0
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?	1
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?	It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?	1
You were going to see her?	I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.	0
Shoot.	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?	1
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?	0
What?	Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.	0
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.	Not if they're where I think they are.	1
WHY?	BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!	1
Now, did you remember that, or...	Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.	1
...Screw you.	No.	0
Did you bring along something to read?	Of course.  How is the old boy these days?	0
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.	Me?	0
Yes.	I don't get it, that really works?	0
So wadda you do with your girls?	Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.	0
Yes.  I am.	Not.	0
You're what?	Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.	0
If you come to Hawaii --	Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.	1
You're as bad as Harry...	I'll go. I'll go.	1
What's that?	I'm sorry.	0
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.	No -	0
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.	Finish, please!	1
For what?	Who you think got your ass outta jail?	1
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.	You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?	1
It's early yet.	I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.	0
You don't believe me.	Cool.	0
Why?	To be closer. So that I could marry you.	1
It sounds like you're doin' really super.	Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...	1
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.	What's the...OH SHIT!	0
And just what is the game?	I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--	0
My dad was a Navy doctor.	Yes.  I can even read star maps.	0
We decided...	Goodbye.	0
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!	In the garden? Would she be there now?	1
How was your plane ride?	The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.	1
Are you relieved?	Yes, but --	1
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.	I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.	1
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.	And you'll play Salome?	0
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.	What did all this stuff cost you?	1
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.	Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.	0
I don't know.	It's my nature.	0
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.	What'd you say?	0
Then, why did you come?	Well, we had talked...	1
What is the scene? Where am I?	This is the staircase of the palace.	1
Oxygen is not the problem.	I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...	0
You get down here!	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?	0
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.	I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?	0
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.	Oh, really?	1
There's a hole! I found a square hole!	That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!	1
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...	Else.	1
Wasn't that close?	Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.	0
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?	No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.	0
It's Elijah.	Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?	0

What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?	Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.	0
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.	Was he morose, or...?  I mean...	1
All the carvings.	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.	0
Is it murdered man?	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?	0
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?	1

I'm a teacher.	You're not the only one.	0
Wisconsin.	Most things.  We're very high on purpose.	0
Beautiful place...	I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...	0

Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...	1
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.	If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.	0

Designer clothes.	She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.	1
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --	Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.	1
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.	It would matter to us.	1
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.	It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...	0
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?	'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'	1
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?	Yes.	1
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.	Certainly not.	0
Hang up the phone.	No, Linda, you don't understan --	1
I√≠m impressed. That information could have cost me ¬£20,000.	"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.	0
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --	-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --	1
Yes, very much so.	Yeah.  I've noticed.	0
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.	Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.	1
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?	All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four√≥thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.	1
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!	Why's that necessary all of a sudden?	0

Who?	Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.	1
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.	That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.	1
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?	Yes, I understand.	0
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.	You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.	1
No --	Y'didn't?	1
Okay.	I thought...	1

Yes. But not as a date date.	Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.	0
Pointing upwards Look...	Did you ahh, love him?	1
I had an abortion two weeks ago.	A flack jacket.	0
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.	I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.	1
Patients have visitors, not doctors.	If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.	0
So you like me, huh?	I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.	1
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.	What if I pay the rent?	0
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.	Sounds respectable.	0
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?	It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.	0
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?	She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.	1
I'm just going to my car?	That's right on my way.	1
There's a lot of people here.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.	0
They're watching us now.	No one can see us now we're alone.	1
I told you.  Nothing --	At the top of the Empire State Building --	1
Hello...?	No.	0
I'm beginning to catch up.	If we could cast it properly, that is...	1
What the hell is going on?	Pool on the roof must have a leak.	1
I love a macho fa√Åade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?	Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.	0
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.	Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.	1
So that's it, just forget about us?	Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.	1
What if she never starts dating?	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.	1
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.	Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.	1
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?	I don't know.  I don't know.	1
A flare up...	Flare up of old emotions...	1
What was <u>that</u>?	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.	1
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.	Didn't take long.	1
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.	Oh.  I better get some spackle.	0
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.	You got worms.	0
How?	Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.	1
Uh-huh. Adam?	Yes, Eve?	1
What?	A.M -- or P.M.?	0
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.	Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.	1
What took you so long?	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?	0
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.	Then why go to the bus station?	0
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!	Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.	0
That's not an answer, is it?	Yes, you're a monster.	1
Shhhh.	I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.	1
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.	Well --	1
I can't.	So what's your excuse?	0
I'm relieved you said that.	No.	0
What do you mean?	The boxes! I TOLD you.	1
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?	Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]	1
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.	Yah.	0
Somebody did that to him.	Yeah.	0
Tom, you okay?	Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.	1
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?	In some situations.	1
Do you want to sleep on it?	Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.	0
Ready for dinner, Brad?	I guess in case one year they're not.	0
That was close...	Me.	0
What hours do you work?	Keep it.	0
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...	Been meaning to talk to you about that.	0
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.	Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.	1
What is it?	The forward airlock.	1
I want that shark alive.	Hiya, kid.	0
Who are you?	What could I be up to, Lula?	0
So...the station is empty?	You get used to the darkness.	0
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?	Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?	1
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.	Why?	0
Do you need a Tagamet?	You have some?	1
Were you scared up there?	You bet.	1
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?	I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.	1
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --	There!	1
Oh, my.	Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.	0
I know, but that's enough.	You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?	1
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.	0
It is	We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.	1
Neither am I.	Fine... fine.	0
If they are?	We'll worry about that when we get there.	1
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...	No.  Nobody but you.	0
Don't rub it in.  I live here.	I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.	0
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.	Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.	1
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?	It will.	0
Water...water...	Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...	0
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.	- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...	0
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.	I don't know. Something's missing.	1
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?	Would you think of me?	0
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.	You got about six more big states to go before we find out.	1
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?	Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.	1
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.	Duquette.  Forget him...	1
Can we get out of here?	Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."	0
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --	I can't just walk away!	1
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft√≥soap twenty editors!	How is he?	0
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.	Believe me, I know.	1
We're engaged.	Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.	1
His.	I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --	0
Such as.	He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.	0
Have you ever been with a male band?	No. It was someone else.	0
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.	I have to show you.	0
Yes. I really would.	Well...	1
Any good?	I think you'll approve.	1
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.	You only made half your quote this year.	0
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.	Really.  He has a cop's face.	0
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.	No.  I'm not.	1
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!	A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.	0
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?	Look, I think we should work things out.	1
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...	Don't be ridiculous!	1
<u>Adolph</u>?	Adolph J. Giron.	1
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?	Plus you have nothing else to do all day.	0
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.	Like what?	1
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.	Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--	1
- end where I began.	Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!	0
Yes sir	Well, good luck with the job.	1
What kind of food?	My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...	0
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.	Lint?	1
... Not yet.	No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.	0
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?	No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.	0
It won't hold.	All I need is the one day.	1
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	1
What are you talking about?	Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?	1
Lazarus?	Oh! Gave me a start.	1
How's it going?	Don't just become excited.	0
Right around here, in the food court.	You punishing Him, ain't you?	0
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.	Why?	0
Why not?	Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "	1
Really?	After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.	0
What's going on?	Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.	1
Yeah?	... Good evening, Louise.	0
Morning.	<i>Morning.</i>	1
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?	All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?	0
Getting loud, getting loud.	He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.	1
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.	Oh.	1
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.	Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.	1
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?	My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.	0
You were?	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.	0
Yeah.	That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.	0
You know, the moment is rather dying here.	You sleeping all right in that house?	0
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.	Who would know where they were hidden?	1
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.	Great.	0
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?	OK, you're right, you're right√ñ  You know, we need to screen what we've got√ñinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types√ñand see what real people think of this.	1
I gotta go get a haircut.	Uh-huh.	1
How?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.	0
What?	No, no.	0
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.	You're a monster.	1
Certainly, Mr. Duke!	It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.	0
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.	0
Yes.	Thank you.	1
What about Larry --	Forget him.	1
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?	Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?	0
It's a piece.	Your sure as hell right about that.	1
No.	I'll loan you a raincoat.	1
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?	Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?	1
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.	I had you transferred to Kigali.	0
But you never had a first date.	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.	1
And I...I've got other things happening.	I'm sure we can match any offer.	1
Hiya, Lou.	Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.	1
Why'd call me a killer?	Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.	1
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.	It's dark.	1
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...	Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.	1
What are you going to do?	It did.	0
Where have you been...?	What's wrong?  What happened?	1
Why would you suppose so?	Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?	0
It's just... y'know... I mean...	79 kilos.	0
Oh, yeah.	Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.	1
It's already started.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.	1
How did I look?	No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.	0
...my feet are hurtin√≠...	I'll support you.	0
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?	In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.	1
Which is guy-speak for...	Like me.	0
But you have had mistresses while you were away.	Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...	0
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?	That's it.	1
Bite?	Yes.	0
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.	Were all these people questioned this afternoon?	1
Yes!	Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.	1
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...	I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.	0
That "thing" gets me excited.	No kidding.	0
Dead?	Okay.	0
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.	....yeah....	1
I suppose. But what if you want to live?	I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.	0
Patrick?	Can we talk?	0
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.	What do you play?	1
Latitude 47 degrees.	Wet. I don't know.	0
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.	I never said that.	1
What are we playing for?	Clothes.	1
Mm - Hmmm...	Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --	0
Bleeding on a country road.	It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.	1
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.	But this is...	1
No good options left?	In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.	1
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!	I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.	0
To the demon king's castle, of course.	And blind people, crippled...	0
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.	Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He√≠s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.	0
And what did you do tonight, honey?	What did he say, exactly?	0
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!	Nothing to tell.	1
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.	Television?	1
Wilson.	And he's a patient of yours?	0
I thought you had a girlfriend.	And why do you tell us this only now?	0
That.	Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --	0
Hello, Ford...	I think so.	0
Maybe we should back off a bit.	I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.	1
No?	I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.	0
I am?	What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,	0
You were enlightened?	Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.	0
They're gone.	Are you sure?	1

Why don't you do it yourself?	Mama!	0
I'll be right back.	out again?	0
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.	Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.	1
What a day - what a heavenly day...	Sorry... I...	0
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.	Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?	1
Suspect Zero.	I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.	0
You almost got us killed!	I guess they're stupid.	0
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...	By whom? The Marquis?	1
Don't run away, Bill.	Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!	0
The city?  New York City?  Why?	Because that√≠s where I live.	1
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.	Yeah.	0
You murdered Gino!	I had to.  You made me.	1
It teaches you to lie.	Not much point to this, is there?	0
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.	Does he know that?	1
That was a great idea, Shorty.	Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.	0
Z!  what are you doing?	I touched a nerve.	0
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.	Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.	0
I spaced out.	Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?	0
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.	They had all the pieces they needed.	0
The eight billion. From them to us.	Right. The eight billion.	1
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.	Sure.	0
Come on.	No, I am.  I am.	1
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.	Yeah?	0
That's all!	And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.	1
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.	That's right -- premature ejection.	0
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?	I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.	1
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.	Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -	1
I owe a lot of money.	I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-	0
Oh, my God...	Okay.  It's good knowing this.	0
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...	No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.	0
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.	I know that.	1
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.	0
How was the dinner?	-- how? --	0
Blackjack?  I don't understand--	I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.	0
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?	I don't know.	1
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?	Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --	0
He's on his way.	He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?	1
You said go between them!	I said don't go between them!	1
You were not.	I was not.	1
It is only me.	My mom uses color-safe bleach.	0
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.	When?	0
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.	You're evil, Maxine.	1
How 'bout Christian Dior?	Is that good?	1
My fault.	But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.	0
Ten years.	It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.	0
But it would hurt.	All the words you've got.	0
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.	Can I talk here? Let me talk.	0
About five years ago.	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.	0
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.	I think that she thinks I may have molested her.	1
Oh no!	None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.	0
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...	Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .	0
Get up!?	Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.	0
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?	Well, the salesman could be available soon.	1
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.	Why not go to work for me?	1
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?	Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.	0
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.	You don't know what you're getting into here.	0
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.	0
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.	People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.	0
What do you think it is?	I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.	1
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.	Really?...	1
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.	Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.	0
And the truth frightened her?	Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.	1
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!	Are you drunk?	1
Do you really not believe in God?	Hey√≥you're little, aren't you?	0
Why not?	Under a hundred.	0
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?	Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...	0
I was wounded before Warsaw.	Clean?	0
Who are you?	Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.	1
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.	No, no.	0
Who?	There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.	1
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.	I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.	1
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.	I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.	1
Jack...	To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...	0
How much does it cost?	Thirty five dollars.	1
I'm at the hospital.	What's the matter?!	1
The winds are picking up.	It's okay if you're not.	0
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.	I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.	0
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?	Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --	1
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --	-- it was a betrayal.	1
I think she's starting to suspect something?	We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.	0
Your friends use the pool too.	I take out the garbage.	1
...Like love...	Exactly.	1
Yes! Hi.	Am I interrupting anything?	1
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.	Maybe she has caller ID.	0
I don't want it now.	Why not? Don't you love Artie?	1
Mr. Warne?	Yeah.	1
Huh?	Vegetables.	1
Don't bother.	Donna?	0
Of course not.	Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.	1
In the head.	John Doe Clubs? What for?	0
Calm down. You're not going to jail.	Nothing.	0
Iunno.	Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.	0
What are you doing?	Your friend saw them.	0
Yeah.	Is this because of your dad?	0
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -	Me too.	1
The Valley?	Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.	0
Annie. Annie Hayworth.	Well, I don't follow movies too much...	0
Yeah, what?	There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.	0
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.	You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?	1
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft√≥soap twenty editors!	Yeah.	1
Put it here.	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.	1
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?	I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.	1
Hey, who's that?	That's your problem, George Bailey.	1
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?	No...as a matter of fact...	1
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.	Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.	1
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.	Some miss all their shots.	0
Then you explain it to me?!	There's nothing to explain	1
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.	You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?	1
That's what it cost, David.	No honey.	0
Come in out of the rain, Bud.	You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?	1
Don't go in.	I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.	1
What's he talking about?	I know, it sucks!	0
What are you doing?	The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.	1
You're weird.	Again?	0
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.	If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.	1
I can't go out.  Not like this.	I think you look beautiful.	1
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.	It's been three.	1
Sure.	Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.	1
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?	Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.	0
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.	I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.	1
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?	-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.	0
What did you use before?	Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.	0
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.	Actually, I just had an amusing thought.	0
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.	Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?	0
Hello?	Yah, is this Marge?	1
Huh?	Gear. You know, clothing.	1
You're wearing your suit --	Beautiful.	0
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--	Certainly!	1
Well, now I feel so much better.	It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.	1
Okay.  These are good.	Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.	0
You see what you're doing, don't you?	What am I doing?	1
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?	I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.	1
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.	Please.	1
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.	But Al is your husband now!	1
What?	Forget him.	0
You guys going to a costume party?	What?	0
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.	I'm sure you understand.	0
Well, they are French.	Right.	1
Me, too.	Enough!	0
What the hell was that?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.	1
You don't trust me?	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.	0
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.	Can't do it.	1
I had to.	I feel naked without it.	0
Come in.	Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.	0
Thank you, sir.	Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?	1
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?	...and your General?	0
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.	What happened to Cole?	1
What were the others?	Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!	0
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...	Sure.	0
But how can you be sure?	No. Please.	0
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.	The other girl is the star?	1
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?	Yes, but no, I can't right now.	1
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.	He sure did.	1
In Ruhengeri?	Yes, when you worked as the nurse.	1
What?	Victor.	1
But you found another choice.	What?	0
Say something it's too quiet.	Umm, Ummmmm	1
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.	0
Caesar, don't.	What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.	1
We have to tell her she's in danger!	This play -- ?	0
No, I think you look... fine.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.	0
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?	0
When?	Let it go.	0
I guess... Are you always so angry?	I can't help girls coming up to me.	0
Don't go in.	She said what you said she'd say.	0
When do you need it?	Yes!	0
I thought you said we were going to be friends.	I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!	1
what I mean?	think that's, uh-	1
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..	So do I.  Sort of.	1
You happy, baby?	Your entire body?	0
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.	It must have taken him a long time to get them together.	1
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.	You were plenty scared that night in the car.	0
Not for a dog.	Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...	1
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.	They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.	1
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?	Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?	0
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.	I thought they were clever.	0
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.	I start Monday week.	1
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?	1
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!	I'll go. I'll go.	0
I don't anymore.	Can I have some?	1
Are you scared?	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.	0
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.	What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.	1
Beer okay?	Yeah, thanks.	1
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.	You took the time to pay the saleswoman.	0
Of course.  When?	I mean home.  India.	1
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.	He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.	0
Huh?	When you were his student? Did he come on to you?	1
But who is left?	I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.	1
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.	Don't start acting hurt.	0
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.	What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?	1
So?  Is that what you said to her?	No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"	1
Oh no!	They won't let you in without one.	1
Changed?	Where's your dress?	1
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.	<u>Apologize</u>?	1
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.	I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.	0
He knows his alphabet.	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?	0
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.	Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.	1
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?	Never really thought about it.	1
Nigger, fuck me hard!	Again!	1
Yeah.	And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...	0
What have you got there?	You'd look naked without one.	1
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.	She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.	1
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.	Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?	1
What's wrong?	Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?	0
Hello.	Hi.	1
Why?	'Cause you're too little.	1
Jack!	Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.	1
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.	Are we talking about me, or chess?	0
What do you mean?	Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.	1
Much.	Is the dizziness gone?	1
Do you always drive like this?	What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.	0
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?	I doubt that.	0
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl	Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.	1
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.	Take it yourself. Take a date.	1
I got the quick-and-ugly version.	An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?	1
Okay?	Fixing my roof.	0
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.	Where'd you learn to do this?	1
You sure have.	Sure...get in!	0
Who are you?	Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.	0
Karen and I just don't want an accident-	I have no intention of having an accident!	1
You mock my pain!	What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?	0
You.  Like the papers all say.	When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!	0
Come on!  I won't tell.	Neither will I.	1
What?	You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.	0
Where were you?	On his six.	1
Not one of Steven's finer moments.	It's ok.	0
I don't want to.	Jam is jam! It's just jam!	0
Really.	And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?	1
I've heard some foolish things in my life.	The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...	0
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??	Huh. Yeah. Maybe...	0
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.	Oh.  Okay.	0
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.	1
Eddie? ...	Yeah?	1
What?	That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.	0
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?	Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.	0
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.	Yes, dear.	0
That's Skid Row... isn't it?	What do you remember?	0
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.	I always did.	0
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.	It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.	1
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.	Meaning my house.	1
She still is.	You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.	0
Thank you.	It's all right.	1
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.	Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!	1
Okay.  How did you find me?	Okay.	0
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.	No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.	1
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.	Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.	1
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"	Gently!!	1
It was the best time of his life.	How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.	1
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.	0
The what?	The Cretaceous.	1
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.	Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.	1
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.	Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.	0
Do you like it?	I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...	0
Are you all right?	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.	1
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?	Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.	0
So?	What's it about?	0
Hello, Barton.	Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.	1
Excuse me?	I'm not in the mood.	1
Let's go home.  Okay?	Okay.	1
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.	But there's no one here, darling.	1
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...	Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.	0
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?	It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.	1
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?	Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.	1
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?	Hello, how are you?	1
A Porsche.	Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!	0
What's that?	I work with retards.	1
Can I have some chips?	Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.	0
That's right.	In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .	0
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.	But I love you.	1
Then what? My boobs are too big?	Look.	0
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?	Of course.	1
Well, look at the plus side.	There's a plus side?	1
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.	Does he go down on you?	0
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.	Still -- those witnesses.	1
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?	You mean you have finished the whole investigation?	0
...What happened?	Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.	1
I wish I could help you.	Maybe you'll think of something...	1
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.	Okay.	1
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --	Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --	1
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!	They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."	0
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?	You're darkening the picture, aren't you?	0
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?	What's wrong?  What happened?	0
George --	Keep moving --	1
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.	Don't start with me again.	1
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.	He's my son!	0
No, Mother, he's lying...	No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?	0
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.	Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.	1
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.	At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.	1
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.	I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.	1
No I'm not.  I'm not star--	I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.	0
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!	Don't go in! Wait for back-up!	1
We're doing something -- ?	Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.	1
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.	I just picked them up on the way over...	1
Bullshit!	No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.	1
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?	Maybe.	1
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.	Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!	1
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"	Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --	0
Um. Thirty-seven.	I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?	1
Well that's great. There goes MIT.	I'll make it up to you!	1
Well, not much longer to go.	Baby, don't do this --	0
Yes.	Very much.	0
Nothing that can't be exchanged.	Oh.  Well.  Good.	1
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.	I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.	0
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.	Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?	1
What year do you think it is?	Have you ever made it with a girl?	0
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.	Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.	1
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...	I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.	1
Isn't there something you...	Not all that pasta.	0
I'm trying to.	I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!	0
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.	0
He kissed her.	With all of it?	0
And how would we neutralize him?	Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?	0
Wer ist da?	Me.	1
You couldn't have made that jump.	I didn't know you were so kinky.	0
So tell me ... am I still an angel?	With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.	1
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.	I'm with Terry.	0
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -	Carolyn!	1
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...	If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.	0
Yes.	Louder please.	1
And you admire that?	It's the only way to play.	1
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...	They've got a book for everything.	0
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.	Yes.	0
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.	A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.	1
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.	No, yes, it does...	1
You did good...	What?	1
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.	Well done you.	1
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.	I'm not sure that I care anymore.	0
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.	1
Alright, Jack!	<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--	1
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.	Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?	1
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?	Maybe.	1
How about Cinderella√≥or a real hot love story?	No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.	1
Sounds quite beautiful.	The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?	0
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.	What?	0
What's wrong?	I'll go and get my valise.	0
With... with Annie, of course.	Anything, Ninotchka.	0
Well I don't know.	Hush, Pearl. Come on.	0
I was sent here by my country to fight you.	All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.	1
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.	I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --	0
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.	Say hello to your mother.	0
Here we are.	Yes.	0
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...	Then you should stay here.	1
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...	She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.	1
What do you think we're doing, dad?	But who?  Where did you meet him?	0
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.	What's that stand for?	1
Why?	You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.	1
Stiffs??	Deceased.	1
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.	Oh, yeah.	1
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?	I just want to talk.	1
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?	It means nothing.	1
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.	Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...	0
Like what?	You sure he's not Italian?	0
Oh -- hello--	It's good to listen to your daddy.	0
What now, my love?	All right...	0
Don't be evasive.	Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --	0
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.	Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.	1
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.	Mmmmm...	0
That won√≠t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.	It√≠s okay. Hell, I√≠ve never paid for it. But please don√≠t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.	1
- guilty.	Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...	1
But that's cause he don't know!	We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.	0
You don't want to talk about it.	I have to...	0
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...	And Tracy's on the move ...	1
It's getting late...	What are you so afraid of, Ellie?	1
Brutal frankness, if you insist.	Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.	0
There's plenty of fruit.	You know where the fire extinguisher is.	1
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --	If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.	1
Are you really that brave?	Knock on wood.	0
Any good?	At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.	0
He's asleep.	Always?	1
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.	Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.	0
You were reading my Renoir.	All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?	0
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.	The best part of ten years.	0
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.	Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...	1
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!	But you tore it up.	0
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...	1
Where is she?	Scams, con games.  How many?	0
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.	I'm sure, I said.	1
What?	Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.	0
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?	In the yellow ribbon.	0
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?	Try a fireman. Less to take off.	0
What do you see? Riddick?	Tell them my house exploded.	0
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!	Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!	1
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!	What?! He's a son of a bitch!	1
Quincy, please...	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.	0
You've been with Gray again.	Aye.	1
Consider it your musical education.	No -- impressed.	0
S'okay....	I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.	0
I gotta go.	Oh, yes... of course.	0
Hello.	A Bill! Not *him*!	0
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.	I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.	0
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.	Nothing wrong with trying.	1
Why are you doing this?	It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?	0
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.	And they loved Bear.	1
That's a long time.	I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.	1
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!	Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.	1
I said, I've seen it before.	Do what?	0
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.	You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?	0
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --	Like I said, yeah --	1
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.	Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!	1
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.	It's been three.	0
I already said hello.	Okay.	1
No... forget it...	I-I never expected anything like this to happen...	1
You're damn right I do.	Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.	1
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?	Yeah.	1
Such a beautiful view.	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?	0
I like that too.	Good night.	0
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?	I don't take those assignments.	1
But you didn't see it, right?	Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.	1
We're getting close...	How, did you know about my grandfather?	0
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.	What did she say?	0
No!	That good, huh?	0
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.	You'll get over that.	1
...What?	I know...	0
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.	Well, it isn't.	0
Is it because I'm here?	What do you think?	1
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.	What did you see?	1
Pigeons... .	You must have a bible in here, don't cha?	0
Who is he?	Yeah.	0
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.	1
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.	Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?	0
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.	0
It relaxes me.	Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.	0
Anthony, Daddy's busy.	I knew it.	0
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.	1
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.	You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.	1
We're not discussing your age.	I'm sure they're just exaggerating.	0
I want to go home.	But could I just tell you this one thing?	1
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.	Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.	0
Right.	...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.	1
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.	Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.	0
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.	Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...	1
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--	0
Come in.  Hi.	Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?	1
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.	You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!	0
Communicate?	Well, now that you've mentioned it -	0
I...can't.	Why not?	1
Yeah. I think it's really sick.	-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.	0
No! Because I --	It was a bitch.	0
Didn't you tell her?	Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.	0
... Mr. President, how good to see you.	It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!	1
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.	Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?	1
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?	You don't understand me.	1
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.	1
Italian?	I'm sorry.	1
Anything?	...I think it's the best stuff I've done.	0
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.	0
Damn.  They're early.	I asked what <u>you</u> thought.	0
And one other thing.	Let me see that.	0
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?	None of your business.	1
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.	Huh?	0
I don't hate you.	Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.	1
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.	Say you love me.	0
What's that supposed to mean?	It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.	1
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.	Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?	0
Why? He can't help us.	Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?	0
Couple months before I was born--	I don't know Toyota. What does he do?	0
Whadda ya think?	How was it contracted?	0
You ever given an injection before.	We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.	0
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --	Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!	1
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?	0
Do you really think he'll show up?	No, no --	0
Uh... gym.	I don't know.	0
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?	Come on in, Betty,	1
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-	And cut that out right now.	1
Of course I'm sure.	What about you? Do you and your father get along?	1
Why?	Come here.	1
Till she showed herself.	Who is?!	0
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!	I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.	1
These are good.	Mm-hmm.	1
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.	Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.	0
You -- covered in my vomit.	Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.	0
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.	What's it all for?	1
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.	You called me Jeffrey.	0
I don√≠t know what you√≠re talking about!	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.	0
You don't know him -	I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.	0
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.	By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.	0
Come again?	Well, take them off.	0
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.	I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came	0
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?	No. But I've got a penknife.	1
Do I sit or stand?	Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...	0
Why, Cyril, you're insane√≥	No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer√≥	1
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...	Who is her agent...?	1
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?	J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.	0
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.	Neither did I.	1
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!	Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?	1
Scottie, Scottie...	It's all over, babe, it's all over.	1
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?	Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."	1
So what?	Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.	1
Major, Major... he's here ...	I always listen to my feelings....	0
I will, David!	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.	1
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.	She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.	0
... I will.	Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.	1
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.	The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?	0
No wonder--without your dinner.	Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.	0
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.	I'm not ready for marriage.	0
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?	I do.	1
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.	You wanna drink?	0
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.	I've heard of it happening.	0
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc√à's in Palermo.	Oh. Right.	1
What the hell do I do now?	Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.	1
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...	I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...	1
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?	No. You'll have to get somebody else.	0
I've been a Little dyspeptic.	I want to get the dog off my bed.	1
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.	Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.	0
You can touch me, I won't bite.	Not too sure about that.	1
Whoever you are, don't call again.	Don't hang up ...	1
Jake, you are never out of your head!	What's in here?	1
Huh?	She always tries to be proper.	1
He looked old, didn't he?	No.	0
I...	No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.	0
Why?	Because I'm done.	1
Happy anniversary, baby.	Happy anniversary.	1
What about the raping?	Shut up.	1
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.	Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.	0
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.	Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.	0
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.	You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.	1
Can I just sit here while you're packing?	If you want.	1
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.	I thought these people were broke.	0
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?	0
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.	I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.	0
But still died.	If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.	1
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.	I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.	0
What?	Nowhere?  I'm...here.	0
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --	Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....	0
Yes, Senator--*twice*.	Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?	1
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?	That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?	1
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.	Where is everybody?	0
... my friend doesn't like it here either.	All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.	1
Still looking.	I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...	0
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?	I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?	1
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.	Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.	1
What are you...?  No.	That sounds kind of pessimistic.	0
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.	Thank you, Mrs. Charles.	1
You really enjoy my company?	Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.	1
Get off my property.	Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.	0
Oh--no, no!	Try a fireman. Less to take off.	0
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.	Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.	1
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.	Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?	0
What happened to your neck?	Why would you care?	0
We start our own class?	Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.	1
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.	He loves you too.	0
You're not much with girls, are you?	Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.	1
So -- how are things?	Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.	1
How's your leg?	You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!	0
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.	1
You know what's good for him?	To win.	1
We sure like havin' you.	SHOOT!!!!	0
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.	Yeah, right, blow it open.	0
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.	Because I want to get married.	0
Six thousand, right?	On the nose.  I tell you what, because you√≠re so cute, I√≠ll take care of our incidentals.	1
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...	Mother, where did you go to law school?	1
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.	Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...	1
K... Cross.	That your maiden name?	1
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.	Football is my life.	0
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.	Who knows, baby?	0
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.	So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?	1
You really think Sheldon's out there?	Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.	0
How old were you?	I never said I didn't.	0
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.	Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.	1
Oh God, I can't believe this.	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.	0
It was full of this awful pink ooze.	That's my girl...  Lights.	0
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?	He's telling the truth, up to a point.	1
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.	What?	0
Let go! We've got to stop!	Now you're the one that's out of your mind.	1
Then what?	I killed them.	1
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?	Oh, no, no, no.	1
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?	I'd been told as much.	0
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.	Call me sentimental.	1
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?	Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.	1
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?	Ok. Where are you from originally?	1
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?	Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.	0
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -	Kip's in trouble	1
Excuse me.	Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.	0
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.	Its bad for you.	1
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.	You'll be fine.	1
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...	Takes one to know one.	0
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.	Blackburn's dead.	0
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.	Oh, you gonna make me say it.	0
Who are you?	I said: don't look.	1
Yum, yum.	Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.	1
You know I do know the way home.	But I√≠m gettin√≠ close, right?	0
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?	Sure -- I don't even feel it.	1
Your daughter's life was just threatened!	Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.	1
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.	Look, I know a little bit about sharks.	1
I don't understand.	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.	1
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!	Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!	1
Is that the truth?	Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?	0
You're late.	You know how I like to make a big entrance.	1
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?	Certainly not.	0
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.	I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?	0
It was a place to start.	You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?	1
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.	Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.	1
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!	Well, when you put it that way.	1
All I did...	You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.	1
Bullshit.	I do, Jill.	1
Who was that?	Grayson - Anne's lawyer.	1
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?	Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?	1
Yes.	Is he straight?	0
What are you going to do?	I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.	1
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -	Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.	1
This is Dorsia?	Without me.	0
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.	Nobody's going to hurt your son...	0
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.	Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.	1
It's the last thing we need.	That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."	1
Yes. She bought my sister's business.	That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.	1
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?	Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.	1
What for?	I gotta take some money out, that's what for.	1
Twenty-two.	Oh, just a day--	0
Where did you get this?	Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.	0
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.	Who is it?	0
Or, it might a been under the mattress.	They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."	0
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.	1
Hello, Brad -	Emily -	1
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?	Not after they're dead.	1
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?	Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.	0
Yes...	You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.	0
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.	After dinner I'll show you my puppets.	0
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.	Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.	0
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!	And as barren of love as stone.	1
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.	She will succeed.	1
I think we may as well sit down.	I guess all the suspects are here.	1
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --	Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.	1
Francesca.	Francesca. Robert.	1
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?	Sure.	1
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!	Vada.	1
How come you're not at Sal's?	Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?	0
Are you okay...?	I'll see you later. All right?	1
Ergo?	What about your father?	1
She left you right?	It's over.  I talked to her this morning.	0
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...	0
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.	Yes...	0
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?	Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.	0
I want you to talk dirty to me.	No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.	0
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.	Tell me -- let me help --	0
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.	That's off now.	1
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?	To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.	1
Will you take me back to my grandparents?	Of course.	1
How much do you weigh?	What one.	0
What?	To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.	1
Lazarus?	It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.	0
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life√≥styles.	Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?	1
Okay.	How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?	0
Home.	How do you know that's the way?	1
He wouldn't.	Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.	1
Doing what?	He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.	1
You got him.	I was shot twice in the back.	0
Uh-huh.	I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.	1
To the church, I must go there.	The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.	0
-- Yes?	Ye-es, Je-an?	0
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.	Wait a minute -	1
Yes.	Yeah.	0
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.	Vivian...	0
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.	This is my area of expertise.	0
Michael...	It's all right, baby.  We're safe...	1
What's he like?	I ain't seen him in a couple of years.	1
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...	I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.	1
What is it?	I don't know - a sharp pain.	1
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.	Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.	1
Oh, I suppose you could do better.	Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."	1
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.	1
Who are you spying on?	Take a look for yourself.	1
What's that?	What?	1
Want a drink?	Yeah.	1
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?	I'll tell you everything later.	0
It was on account of the birthday party.	I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.	0
Busy tomorrow?	Clockworks.	0
They tried to kill you?	He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.	0
Lemme see that.	So what?	0
I'll do my best.	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.	1
What's going on?	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.	0
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!	I got the message you called too.	0
Hey look!	Of course.	0
It looks wonderful.	You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...	1
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?	I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.	0
What?	Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.	1
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?	Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.	1
Yes..	Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.	1
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.	Yes.	0
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.	I believe that, don't you?	0
Oh, yeah, yeah.	I'll see yuh.	1
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--	No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]	1
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.	It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?	1
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---	0
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...	Make it our first date.	0
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?	He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?	1
I know.	Yeah?	0
Is that customary?	It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.	1
Have they located my daughter yet?	I don't know. Something's missing.	0
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?	0
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.	Well, this *is* an orphanage.	0
He do that every year?	The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -	0
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.	You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.	1
So what do you use, then? A stake?	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --	1
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.	I'll drink to that.	1
I'm afraid I'll faint.	Whatever you do, don't do that.	1
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?	I told you! I've got everything!	0
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.	Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.	0
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?	Kelly--	0
You know Chastity?	I believe we share an art instructor	1
What's wrong with me?	It's been known to happen.	0
Gus, have you ever been in love?	Leave.	1
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?	We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.	0
Okay. Thank you.	Whatever.	1
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.	I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....	0
Yes sir.  What's that?	A dressing bag.	1
You've been married twice --	It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?	1
Nepal? Have you been?	Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.	1
Really?	With a vengeance, I hated them.	1
It is an emergency, isn't it?	Figures.	0
But I like it I guess.	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?	1
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."	How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.	0
What are you doing?	Just wanted to see.	1
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.	Yeah, yeah, sure.	0
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?	In the yellow ribbon.	1
-- but you never were much of a tit man --	I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.	0
No.	How about California?	1
I can't sleep.	Oh... I got something for that.	1
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?	Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?	0
You're a sweet man, Richard.	No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.	0
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?	No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.	1
I really don't have much of an appetite.	So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.	0
Will I like it?	That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!	0
I don't know.	No. I'll be right back.	0
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.	Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.	1
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.	Do you want us to come with you?	1
Didn't hear it.	You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!	0
Who said that?	I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.	0
He saw her at the Northern Care...	...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...	1
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?	Yes am.	1
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.	No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?	0
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --	I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.	0
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.	You're lucky. They kill as well.	0
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...	Thank you.	0
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?	Then you're crazy.	0
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.	You can never be too early or too thin.	1
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.	Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.	0
That's what you get flight pay for.	Maybe I shouldn't take it.	1
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.	Sorry, Mom!	0
Oh, come on.	Ohh!	1
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.	The official term is "psychotic".	0
It's only eight o'clock.	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.	0
What is this stuff? Kevlar?	Better. It's not on the market yet.	1
Not even a little bit?	I'm guessing no.	0
I-	No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.	1
A big one....	Don't sweat it.  It's over.	0
So why did you come back here, Sam?	Who is Jesus?	0
Everybody hates me!	Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.	0
What?	You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.	1
I don't have any proof, Palmer.	I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.	0
No, Odette says he's in shock.	How can we help him.	1
Yeah. What?	Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.	0
Go ahead.	Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!	0
Get on this, right now...	I'm sorry but you're...	0
Yeah?	What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?	0
Are you going to yell at me?	About what?	1
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.	With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.	1
Yeah.	Now you understand?	0
It isn't working any more, David.	I just can't look at you the same way.	0
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.	Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?	1
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.	Y'think?	1
You want the cake!?	You know we're right.	0
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.	What?	0
Um-hmm.	Mm.	0
Do you know what to do?	Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.	0
What was it?	He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.	1
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.	Tell me about it...	0
What do you think?	It's the best collection I've ever seen.	1
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.	1
No.	All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.	1
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.	Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.	0
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?	I can't wait for you to meet her!	0
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.	I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....	0
Yeah.	Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.	0
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.	I am?	1
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...	I don't understand.	1
Both.	Holy sh--	1
I don't know.	If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...	1
Tell me about yourself.	I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!	0
Yes.	Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?	1
Maestro.	Good morning.	1
Gregory √≥√≥  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.	And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.	0
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.	Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.	1
The turkey in?	But Al is your husband now!	0
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?	Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.	1
Hello, Mr. M.	... It's a pretty short trip.	0
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?	Hello.	0
Zukovsky...	Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.	0
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.	Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.	0
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.	I can't go all the way down south.	1
<u>Oh my God</u>!	Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.	0
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?	If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.	0
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?	Hal has it.	1
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?	Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.	0
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.	Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?	0
That's not funny.	Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.	0
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.	Just didn't get around to it, huh?	0
Why not?	There was so much going on.	0
What do you mean by that?	Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.	1
There's no end to your accomplishments.	No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.	0
No.	Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.	0
When was the last time you cleaned this place?	Hmmm?	1
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?	Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?	1
Doc...	I see it...	1
Do you like it?	Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.	1
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.	I don't remember any of this.	0
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.	0
Would you excuse me?	Sure.	1
Yeah, like that.	Look, it can wait till Sunday.	0
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.	I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.	1
Jack, I --	No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.	1
Huntington Beach, California.	No. I --	0
So I've noticed.	Will you marry me?	0
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....	You're not a pain in the ass....	1
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.	Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.	1
God, if Chet found out he'd...	Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.	0
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.	There's nothing wrong with me!	1
Never heard of him.	Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.	1
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?	Birdshit?	0
What's the matter?	...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...	0
No, but it's getting there.	Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?	1
What?	How long have you been waiting?	1
Can I open it?	Yeah...	0
What's that got to do with it?	Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?	1
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?	I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.	1
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!	Where?	1
Why is it?	Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --	1
It is fish.	I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.	0
Wonderful. Uh...	Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...	1
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.	There was.	1
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?	I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...	0
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.	0
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.	OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...	1
You're not going out to look for them?	Both.	0
Yes.	Yes, I do.	0
Are you all right?	You've thought of everything.	0
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...	No. You'll have to get somebody else.	0
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...	I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?	1
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.	You want a tip?	1
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.	Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?	1
A little longer, Paul?	So you married your father's business partner?	0
No, I think I'd remember.	Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.	1
Oh, Rocky!	A misunderstood bachelor.	0
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.	Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.	1
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!	I told you.	1
Steve said for you to start on the boats.	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.	0
Sheriff, I don't...	C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...	1
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!	I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.	0
I'll take Cathy up to bed.	I wasn't finished.	0
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.	1
That machine --	Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.	0
You have a helluva way of asking for help.	You have a helluva way of answering.	1
What do you mean√≥starvation?	It takes money to buy food.	1
I thought you were supposed to keep them.	Okay, fine. Sure	1
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?	Did you?	1
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!	We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.	0
Mu Bai...It's been too long.	All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.	0
You know who The Raincoats are?	I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.	0
I want to go home.	Will you come with me?	0
Yes, you should go.	At least you walked.	0
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!	I... You're not going to understand this.	1
Are you sure?	Oh, I didn't hear you come in.	0
Sue Ann Hanson.	You mean --	1
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.	1
...There's a start for a meeting.	I know it's none of my business --	1
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?	You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.	1
Where you been?	I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.	1
All right.	You are, aren't you?	0
Who are you!  Who are you!	Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?	0
I mean what did we know about anything?	I absolutely agree with Marge.	0
A dead one.	I√≠m out of the doghouse?	0
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.	How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?	0
All the carvings.	But there's a sad catch to the story.	1
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?	Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.	0
But then how can you...	I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.	1
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.	0
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...	Stop it!	1
Well, haven't you got anybody else?	There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!	1
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...	It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.	0
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.	Care to make a wager on that?	0
I'm sorry --	-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.	1
Not yet, Mr. Clark.	When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.	1
He's going to be a fireman.	I've noticed.	0
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?	Electra --	0
Shot!  Who shot you?	I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?	0
I never hear the whistle.	Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.	0
I don't want it on me.	Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!	0
Hey, Mike?	What? Are you all right?	1
Thirty-nine.	Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.	0
Uh-huh.	Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.	0
Yeah.	Sixth is faster.	0
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.	I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.	0
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...	All paved with diamonds and gold?	1
Why? What for?	Great.	0
You are very kind.	All right, let's go.	0
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.	Every one of 'em... .	1
You shouldn't smoke.	What do you mean, next?	0
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.	You haven't finished your beer.	0
Happy for him.  And relieved.	So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?	1
Two hundred.	Two hundred pounds?	1
And the pony?	Call the police?	0
Out where?	Was over to Baby Suggs.	1
Something's happened to them.	Uh, right.  A... news story.	0
Aren't we early?	Little celebration before we set off.	1
That's enough of that kind of talk!	I just said--	1
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.	We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...	0
What feelings?	Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...	0
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.	That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami√≥  for the love of it?	1
I remember you...in the elevator.	Are they moulting now?	0
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?	Fine. He's very nice.	1
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.	Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.	1
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.	But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...	1
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?	Am I a thing?	0
I wish you would.	I know that...	0
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.	I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?	1
I just had a terrible thought Harry.	What's that?	1
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --	Ethan Hunt.	0
They'll mend.	God, you're beautiful.	0
What does he look like?	And look what I got.	0
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.	I don't believe you.	0
So what are you doing with a dog?	Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.	1
Well, something stinks.	So where do you go from here?	0
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.	You sucked his dick!	0
Why are you smiling?	We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?	0
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...	Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.	1
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.	0
As large as castles.	Maybe yes. Maybe no.	0
Suck my dick!	I... do you want me to leave?	0
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?	Oz.	1
That horrible woman!	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.	1
Neil, you could have burned the house down!	I don't <u>know</u> how it started!	1
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.	But they have.	1
Are you dead?	No.	1
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...	You fuck for money.	0
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.	I thought you might have.	0
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."	Okay, yeah.	0
He told me last night.	I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.	0
Why? Who said?	Thomas Sandefur...	1
Everything is gone, now.	Nothing is left but us.	1
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!	Sure, all drifters do.	0
What is?	All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.	1
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?	We moved out after that. Upstate.	1
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!	The south pole.  TimeœÄs flowing backwards.	0
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.	Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.	1
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.	Cheers.	1
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -	My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--	0
Enjoying your reading?	What's happenin'.	0
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.	You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.	1
What?	What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?	1
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.	Oh, I'm sorry about that.	1
Nope.	How did you find me?	1
You look beat.	Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.	0
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?	I know √≥√≥ I shouldn't have told you√≥	0
Lower.	Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?	0
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.	Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.	1
And what do you do about it?	Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.	1
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?	Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.	0
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?	I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.	0
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.	You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.	1
What's an audience going to tell you?	I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.	1
No we don't.	Well how long has this been going on.	1
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?	What about this Beetle guy?	0
Peter Kelson?	Yes... and you are?	1
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.	I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.	1
Who's that?	Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.	0
You're a policeman.	The same thing you do.	0
Where's Corbett?	'Cause he wouldn't lie.	0
Hello again, neighbour. I didn√≠t intrude, did I?	...brazen-it-through...	0
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.	Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --	0
Oh, yeah?	I, yeah.	1
Hauser, you're lost your mind.	You'll find out.	0
It hit me like a ton of bricks.	How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.	1
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.	Which means he went toward sunrise.	1
Yes.	Sorry?	0
M'hm.	Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.	0
Just get some people out of our house.	I want to buy a car.	0
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.	0
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.	Namely?	1
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.	What do you mean by that?	0
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.	Which?	1
The kid. Junior.	Gone.	1
Any sign of Sounder?	There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.	0
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.	I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.	1
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.	1
Dad?	Goodnight.	0
I'm here, Harry.	...yes?	1
A good reason, I suppose.	Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...	1
Uh-huh.	Oh no!  UUH.	0
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!	Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.	0
What id we run into someone I know?	Watch out!	0
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.	Do you remember the last time you saw him?	1
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.	Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.	1
What's that?	Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!	0
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...	Annie---	1
Still.  All's fair in love and w...	Patch him through....	0
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?	Didn't I say that?	0
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.	You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?	0
I'm sorry, Walter.	Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.	1
Of course I think about it every day.	You hate that.	0
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --	I miss you.	1
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.	I don't have to. I've got them right here.	1
Please? What friends?	You better not sing that song.	0
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother	Where are your skulls and bones?	0
Then what are we going to do?	Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?	0
What have you been doing?	Joanna, I don't give a--	0
You're not.	No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!	1
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...	I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.	1
Yeah, sweetheart?	It's fun.	0
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?	Where have I been?	1
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --	That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...	1
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!	Your legs don't look broke.	0
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?	Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?	1
She what?	You were going to have this thug...?	0
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.	I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.	0
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.	That is not true. They have tried to help me.	0
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.	Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.	0
Shoot him.	Shoot him? Like with a gun?	1
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I√≠m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather√≠s name, the glory of my people.	No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.	1
... What's going on?	Just do it, Amy, please, go.	1
You already packed up your stuff?	And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...	0
I don't know anything about it.	No way.	0
Now, get out!!	Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...	0
Who?	Frances, it's me, Harry?	1
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.	No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.	0
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?	That's right.	1
Where we going?	It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.	0
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.	Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?	0
Why won't you talk to me?	Will you leave me alone?  Please.	1
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.	Just sit back and enjoy the show.	1
You what?	I want to be the way I was before.	1
That's the Farren house.	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --	0
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.	Duane?	1
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.	What's that?	1
Who was the last person you had sex with?	Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.	0
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.	Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.	1
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.	Too big. More like a freighter.	0
What do you want, Stan?	Can I... I brought some --	1
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.	1
Still afraid somebody may see us together?	Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.	0
Okay...	Is this the only way?	1
He deals in pain.	Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.	0
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...	No.	0
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.	I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.	1
Where'd you leave 'em?	It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.	0
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.	That's a fact.	1
I know your parents.	He was?	0
I just heard.	I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --	0
You and he are not doing things?	No!	1
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.	0
No.	We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...	1
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.	Wait.  I want to tell you something.	1
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.	0
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.	Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?	0
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?	Just now?  Overnight?	0
Our little paradise -- just made for two?	Not quite.	1
...school's fine...	Do you know the answer to this?	0
What?	Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.	1
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?	You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.	1
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.	You expect me to buy this?	0
Get married. Have a wedding.	No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?	0
I can't.	You have to.	1
You pay me.	You're a very unusual stenographer --	1
Yes, that's right.	Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?	1
I don't want to. It's different.	And now you tell me.	1
I told Walter.	Does he still love you?	1
And all this will be for real?	If you want...	1
Here with you.	And it's a all real.	1
What?	Yeah.	0
You don't?	Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...	0
So what I want doesn't matter?	But I feel like√≥ My friends won't talk to me.	0
I want some more.	We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.	0
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?	The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.	1
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.	I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.	0
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --	What do they look like?	1
I do okay.	You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?	1
Nine.	You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his √± what about before that?	0
It was very specific.	What teacher?	0
Ask them to sit down.	Pray?	0
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.	They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.	0
Just local, of course.	Like hugging a lamp post.	0
From pursuing your chosen profession.	I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.	1
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.	Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?	0
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?	Never quit a winner.	0
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.	I don't wanna go.	1
With me.	Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.	1
You knew...?	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.	0
Where is she?	Standing next to my window.	1
What happened to your eye?	Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?	1
Huh?	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.	0
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...	Why would I want to leave? I like it here.	0
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --	I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.	0
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.	Yes.  Here I am again.	0
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.	1
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.	Well....	0
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.	Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.	0
Have I been a good wife?	Yes.	1
Like you could find one	See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?	1
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.	Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.	1
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.	No.  I'm up.	0
I read the article.	Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.	1
Sorry.	There is something missing here.	0
...What?	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.	0
He's mooing.	You wouldn't?	1
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.	That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...	0
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.	Oh, this?√≥I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.	0
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Are you listening to a word I'm saying?	0
Welcome home.	The best part of ten years.	0
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Because I like to torture you.	1
The same.	Don't you ever cook anything?	0
I got the message you called.	Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?	0
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?	Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...	1
Miles?	Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.	0
I just wanted to say hello.	You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?	1
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.	That tall, bright building.  Near there.	0
Why?	Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.	1
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.	No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.	1
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?	Take it where?	0
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.	Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?	1
What do you want?	You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.	0
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?	1
It?	Coffee?	0
Oh, don't worry about that.	I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.	0
Is that a problem?	Not for you, clearly.	1
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.	Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.	0
I got some vodka in the freezer.	Got some o.j.?	1
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.	You're gonna have surveillance all over you.	1
Thank you.	No problem.	1
Hi, baby.	Baby goddamn scared me to death!	1
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?	We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.	0
Anything this time?	I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.	1
You got it in a bar?	No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?	1
I don't want it reported!	Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that√≥	1
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?	We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.	0
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.	Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.	1
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...	Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.	0
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.	You're right. It makes no sense.	0
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.	Oh well... branding will do that to you.	1
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.	Where are you going?	1
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.	That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	0
That's why I'm asking.	Because this pain√≥in√≥the√≥ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.	1
I had to see you.	What's up?	1
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...	You're going to stay here...?	1
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.	Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.	0
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!	No. Not like you.	0
You don't know me.	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.	0
it's my first time.	That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-	1
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.	Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!	1
No.	Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.	1
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.	Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.	1
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?	0
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.	I just do what the doctor says, babe.	0
Well, Steve?	Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?	1
Sabotage?	Came to get a tan.	0
Yes, I am.	No, you're not.	1
Harry-?	What was the first thing?	0
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.	I wouldn't read too much into it.	1
Piss off!	Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It√≠s important.	1
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.	I don't follow you.	0
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?	I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.	1
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.	Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.	0
Maybe she died.	Hi.	0
My mom told me not to stay in this town.	Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.	0
I did not think so.	You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.	1
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...	0
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!	0
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?	Me?	1
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.	Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -	0
Hello?	Hello, is this Pam?	1
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.	I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.	0
It'll be over soon.	No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.	1
On the Baltimore and Ohio.	Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.	0
Thank you.	Don't be late.	1
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...	No, I'm fine... really...	1
I understand completely, sir.	Tonight?	0
I don't want to leave you.	Your daughter needs you.  Go.	1
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.	What's your mother doing this afternoon?	0
No!  Why would I want to kill him?	Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....	0
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?	No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.	1
Because I know you're full of shit.	I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.	1
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?	What about us? What about me?	1
You're shaking.	It's the tension.	1
Am I interrupting?	Not yet. Not married.	0
You never have dessert.	Never is a long time.	1
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.	Criminals.	0
You're cold.	I don't think I am.	1
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?	The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -	1
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?	0
Get ready to go.	Terrific.	0
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.	1
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.	It needn't be.	1
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?	You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.	1
Hi, is this your first time calling?	Yes it is.	1
She won't go to St. Cloud's!	How about California?	0
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.	He wants to show now.	1
You're angry--	I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.	0
Jack!	This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.	0
You...	I got what I paid for.	1
You're one man. You can't save everybody.	No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --	0
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.	Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.	1
But Wynant --- ?	I don't believe he did it.	1
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.	You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.	0
It was like some big fucking secret!	What was?	1
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?	Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.	0
Roy! What are you doing here?	You're in serious danger!	1
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?	Maybe.	0
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.	Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.	1
That is correct.	Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?	1
It's a Calder.	I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.	0
You should hear the bird.	"There's more light here," he says--	0
So -- are you travelling under R?	You know what -- I am.	1
Okay, no problem.	We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--	0
Stop that ma'am crap!	Three hundred?	0
Is there another way?	What?	0
You don't believe that.	Of course, at once.	0
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.	1
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --	I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --	1
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.	0
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.	Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?	1
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...	You think I didn't get that?	0
I don't know.  A lot.	Do you know that?	0
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.	I am?	1
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.	I've got a situation here and --	0
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?	-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --	0
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.	No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.	1
How did you know this was my car?	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.	1
Are they usually like that?	Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?	0
Uh-huh.	You sure?	1
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...	What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.	1
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?	1
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?	The Cowboy??	1
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.	It's all right.  It's not hurting...	0
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Come on, let's go.	0
On your first time --	Who said it was my first time?	1
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.	Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!	0
No, you don't.	How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.	1
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.	Uh-huh.	1
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.	His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.	0
Why not?	We'll move in Sunday.	1
Yes?! But --	Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...	0
How would you like to take me to dinner?	Maybe a little of both.	0
Do you have many friends?	Put that shit away, they're here.	0
Now what are you doing?	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...	0
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --	Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?	1
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.	1
You will.	That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.	0
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.	All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.	0
No	Well I think you should.	1
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --	-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.	1
I keep thinking of Annie.	You were afraid of heights?	0
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.	Cured, yes.	0
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....	Come on, I'll show you around.	1
Be open with me. I'd like that.	There may be things you'd rather not know about.	1
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.	Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?	0
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.	Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?	1
I got it all ready. Here.	Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?	1
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?	Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.	0
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.	We're gonna get married.	0
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.	Thank you, but I really have to go.	1
I'm in love with Lloyd!	Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-	1
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --	1
Anyone else?	This is insanity.  Sally...	1
He's got the shakes?	Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?	1
If you wouldn't mind.	I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.	1
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?	It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?	0
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...	No.	0
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.	WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!	1
It's the same image - Kong!	What?	0
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.	...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?	0
What's your fucking problem?	Why's it always my fucking problem?	1
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.	Oh, yes... of course.	0
I know.	I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?	1
Truman, that was our house!	I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.	1
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.	I think television's a dangerous thing.	0
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.	Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?	1
What did you find? What did you see?	I found sand. I saw death.	1
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.	Where are we?	0
No dogs, huh? Okay.	And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.	1
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.	You'd better before you catch the disease!	1
Twenty-two.	Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.	1
Really?	Yeah.	1
Oh, get it over with.	I don't suppose... no...	1
...I don't know.	For now. These relationships never last too long.	0
Right here.	I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.	0
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?	0
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.	Donna?	0
Do you know what you√≠re doing?	Like riding a bike.	1
What can be done has been done.	MOTHER! Tell me!	1
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?	I feel right now like there's one burning in me.	0
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?	Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.	1
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?	It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.	1
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.	You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.	1
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.	Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.	0
I should have told you sooner --	Think I could rent a scooter?	0
Got anything to drink in there?	Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.	1
Please! Please! What are those?	Five.	0
We had an argument. He's being silly.	I swear, I don't know this girl.	1
You're not capable of it.	The Ribbon Manufacturers.	0
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?	From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...	0
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."	Where's that?	1
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."	Are they worth reading?	1
...Why?	Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.	1
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.	Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?	0
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.	I saw one.	0
Gabriel!	That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.	1
Walt!	Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.	1
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.	Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.	1
With Jennifer.	Absolutely.	0
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.	Stay away from me, Jez.	0
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --	0
That's incredible.	I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.	0
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?	1
You say it just to calm me!	Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!	1
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.	No. But he hands them over.	1
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.	What?	0
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.	I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...	0
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.	But you enjoyed it, yes?	1
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!	0
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.	I nearly died when we split the bill.	1
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.	Especially tonight.	1
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.	Bene! Bene!	0
I think so.	Yes.	0
I'm going to my mother's.	Not yet.	0
Who?	The mean old man with the claws.	1
C√≠mon, Jack, you think there aren√≠t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I√≠m doing in New Jersey...	That√≠s a big one for me, too.	1
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...	Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.	1
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.	Fry 'em.	0
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.	How long...?	1
Neo, how did you do that?	What I say is, no. We don't do partners.	0
Joanne?	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.	0
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...	That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!	1
How about a plane?	But you have a right to let us know what you think.	0
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.	Meet again, sometime.	0
Of course.	I'm in construction.	0
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.	You have to leave the house immediately!	1
What about you, Buddy?	Brains aren't everything.	0
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.	You wouldn't believe me.	0
Gabe!  Are you alright?	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.	0
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?	It's one idea...	0
I should have told you sooner --	I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --	1
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!	Let me come in.	0
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.	Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?	0
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --	Hey! Where's that martini?!	1
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.	...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.	1
What did you say?	How long has this been going on?	0
Who is it?	Naw, in the ring, a dive is-	0
Why's that?	Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.	1
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.	Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.	0
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.	Goodbye, Mary.	1
Go away.	There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?	1
Oh --	All hollow.  Oh --	1
Well... what happened?	I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...	1
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.	I know...and I'm really sorry.	0
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.	No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.	1
Dad - - Dad - -	I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.	0
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.	1
--And he has sex appeal.	So what?	1
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.	Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?	0
I like you, too, Nathan.	My father proposed to my mother in there.	0
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.	She took my head.	1
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?	Ya puttin' me on, right?	1
Maybe I'll do that.	I brought these, but clearly...	0
I can't...and I won't.	Who's Dr. Tom?	0
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.	I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?	1
He was trying to tell me something.	Did you mail then?	0
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.	So we need two people, two women.	0
I thought they came right past here √≥√≥	Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.	0
Your bed?	Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...	1
God.	Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...	0
You live in the neighborhood?	Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.	1
Hey.	Okay.	0
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.	Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.	1
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...	What will they be made of?	1
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.	No. To thoroughbreds.	0
No-no-no...	I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?	1
What is this?	Get in bed.	0
My car's in the garage.	Um --	0
How ingenious! Tell me about them.	Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.	0
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.	What's the matter?	0
What was that?	For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-	0
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?	Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.	1
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.	Where to?	0
What shall we do?	I really can't give out any information right now at this point.	0
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?	Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.	0
...Which one...?	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.	0
What do you know about hypnosis?	Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.	1
Older.	You afraid to try?	0
Huh?	Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?	0
How's the trout?	It tastes like fish.	1
Homey.	See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?	1
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.	Oh...with his ear infection!	1
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.	Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?	1
Alex you can't -just leave.	No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...	0
Have you ever tried American girls?	Let me come in.	0
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?	I...	0
I hate Sadie.	Well you'll always be Sadie to me.	1
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.	Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	1
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.	Say what?	0
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.	What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?	1
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.	It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.	1
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.	0
Well, I'll come back later.	No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.	1
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.	0
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.	-- we can't now.	0
Jak'tahla?	Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --	0
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!	I wish he had a family, though.	1
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...	1
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...	Why should you care?	1
Holy shit!	That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.	0
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?	Please sit down...	1
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.	Showing you what?	1
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?	I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!	1
I'm hungry.	Call room service.	1
What?	Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.	1
Why didn't you come to me?	I don't know.	1
But I thought high school is only four years.	No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.	0
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?	I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...	1
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.	Yeah.	0
Good. Where are we?	Some committee's got it.	1
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...	They're dead.	1
I'm not giving up.	You must.	1
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	No thanks, Lee.	1
Well... are you self-conscious about it?	I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.	1
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.	You do?	1
What?	I used to eat there... Really good noodles.	1
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...	The one that goes underwater?	0
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.	1
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.	No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.	1
Will you call me?	I don't have your number.	1
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.	Great.	1
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.	Are you serious?	0
Why should I?	...The red piece of shit over there...	0
Do what? I haven't done a thing.	Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...	0
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.	0
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.	I'm thirty-four.	0
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?	1
Do you want to get it now?	Now?	1
That's normal.	I don't want to.	1
Monsieur Rick?	Yes?	1
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?	Oh, I hope a long, long time.	0
You must think I'm some kind of fool.	What do I do?  How do I spin this?	0
Yes.	How?	1
Do you take risks?	In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.	1
Can't you get him?	Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.	1
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.	Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..	1
Who?	That kid... the hairdresser.	1
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.	He requested this?	1
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!	I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--	1
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.	Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --	0
Ha! Where's that?	The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.	1
Something like thirty-six.	Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.	0
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.	Anti social?	0
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.	And it doesn't cramp your style?	1
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.	This is getting serious.	1
When do you think you'll get leave again?	Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.	1
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?	If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.	1
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.	I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.	1
Oh, it's the way you talk.	Is it ... is it, really?	1
This is nice.	Never been here before?	1
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.	Soran?	1
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.	I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.	0
It just seems...kind of weird.	C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?	0
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?	A simple leak, if it's okay with you.	1
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.	You're right. It makes no sense.	1
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.	Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.	0
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.	Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.	0
What night?	Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.	0
How's that?	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.	1
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --	1
No.	Oh.	1
Where are we going?	Mathilda?!	0
It's true.	Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.	1
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.	You did. You're right.	0
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.	I'm not, I'm very happy.	0
The zoo?	Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?	1
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...	Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?	1
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.	I think they help.	1
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.	If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.	0
But wishes don't come true.	Certain wishes do.	1
Deputy... good evening.	What brings you out to these parts?	1
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.	Transference.	0
You got the schematics?	Everything.	1
I have to go back now.	You do?	0
What do I have to do?	Are you sure?	0
Where's the old highway?	You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.	1
But how?	I don't know.	1
Don't Louis --	Louis, put me in my coffin...	1
And you have written pictures, haven't you?	I want someone I know to take me in.	0
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.	How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.	0
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.	Just go.  We can manage without you.	1
Oh--no, no!	There is time. It is still dark.	1
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.	It's kind of you to see me.	1
Oh Miles!	What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.	1
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.	I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.	0
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...	Nothin'...	1
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?	I need a shower.	0
I'm not going.	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--	1
No!  It will cave in!	You really use strong language.	0
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?	I went for a walk.	1
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman√≥a trip like this.	0
I want him to at least see the sky!	--and we will--	1
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.	Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!	0
Did something happen to make you care about reality?	Yeah.	0
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...	I don't know anything that isn't police business.	0
Hey.	Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.	0
Friend?	It was a mercy-killing after all.	1
Nothin'.	No.	0
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.	I laugh sometimes	1
No.	Get out	0
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.	0
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.	That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.	1
Oh, Mr Crane--	I know that.	0
He's beautiful.	Yeah, well they may this one.	0
She grew up.	Because I have to!	0
It'll be over soon.	Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --	0
Mmm, needs a little something.	What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.	1
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...	Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.	1
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!	Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.	0
Like a veil has been lifted?	Love a cup of tea. With lemon.	0
Then you went freelance?	Growing a beard...	0
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.	They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.	1
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?	No problem. I'm not in a hurry.	0
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.	Yeah. Good.	1
When did you decide all this?	Few days ago.	1
A man wouldn't do that...	So would I.  But it's not mine to give.	0
You sure?	The creek bed --	0
Did you need it?	But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.	0
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?	Yes.	1
You up?	No. Have you seen my glasses?	1
Yes!	And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.	0
But Kirk...	We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...	1
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.	She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.	0
Check.	Holy shit!	0
So what'd the other guy look like?	Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.	1
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--	What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.	0
And you're at this third stage	No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.	1
Harry -√±	Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.	1
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.	So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?	0
You don't like this, I take it?	Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It√≠s important.	0
What's that?	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.	0
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.	I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.	0
You've done five of my ideas.	You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?	1
I don't know... Switzerland?	We'll find him.	1
I'm still not clear on Chaos.	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.	1
Does you mother still work?	She's retired.	1
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.	I'll be here.	1
So that gives you something.	It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.	1
-- we are?	Various enterprises, style of thing.	0
You're one of them, aren't you?	What do you mean?  What happened!	0
What are you doing here?	Ma...	0
A late night or an early morning?	Late night.  You?	1
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.	1
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.	Don't say that, Edie, don't...	1
About a year and a half.	I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.	0
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --	Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.	0
What?	When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.	1
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.	Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.	0
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.	Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.	1
Duff, I love you.	Looks just like it did.	0
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?	Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.	0
Would you like me to help you pass them back?	I don't need your help.	1
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.	I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...	1
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?	Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.	1
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?	Great.	1
What am I going to do?	You want to go talk to him?	1
Oh, Harold.	For you.	1
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.	You getting into bed to think about yellow?	1
'Thief in the Night?'	Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?	1
They're right here.	It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.	0
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.	Hold on.	1
Then what do you think?	That you're just like your mother.	1
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.	Always wanted to see the upper lines.	1
The great communicator.	Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.	0
Yeah.	Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.	0
You stay inside. I will see to them.	I will appreciate that.	1
Something like that.	I can't see them!	0
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???	Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?	0
How?	I don't know for Christ's sake!	1
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...	So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?	1
Do you like the way I feel?	Yes.	1
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...	You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.	0
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.	Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.	0
But you're his brother.	He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?	1
I don't know. Should you?	My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."	1
But what about...	Jackie, can we --	0
The guy died.	Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.	0
For exits off Main Street.	I can't do that.	0
What was that?	Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.	1
He's dead, huh?	Never is a long time.	0
What if I say no?	I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.	1
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.	Did your husband know Quaid?	1
Am I wrecking my car?	Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.	1
You bastard.	It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.	1
never doubted you for a second.	That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.	0
Yeah, it's good to get together.	You could do that?	0
What's the matter?	My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.	1
I never met anyone from Seattle before.	You're not missing much.	1
There isn't any more to tell.	Don't say that.	1
And ...your friend?	She's left.	1
Why? Who are you?	I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.	0
I thought you didn't know how to drive.	I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.	1
What?	You had four offensive rebounds.	1
You mean the one who --	Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --	1
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.	Yeah, and whose fault is that?	0
It√≠s the past. It√≠s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let√≠s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.	Uh-huh.	0
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?	I'm never unfair.	0
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.	Look.	0
Seventy-five.	... It's a pretty short trip.	0
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.	Father's friend.	0
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.	Now what could he sell at three in the morning?	0
How do you know?	Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.	0
Neither am I.	But it's all you do.	1
Lucy.	So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.	1
I was right. you are Superman.	So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.	0
Hello?	You must hate it.	0
What if I say no?	No. That is, I didn't√≥  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though√≥  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.	0
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.	Laugh it up.	0
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".	Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.	1
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.	Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.	0
They put you in charge?	Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother√≠s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he√≠d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...	0
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.	Oh.	0
You never told me why you got kicked out of...	He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--	0
Every day.	Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?	0
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.	1
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.	Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?	1
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.	They shrink when they're marinated.	0
I'm saying they came into my yard.	You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?	1
It's a little late for that.	Big enough radio, I don't see why not.	0
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.	How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!	0
Oh.	Don't do this.	0
Come on, Will.	I was a lot earlier.	0
What a nice place.	Yeah, the tree makes it nice.	1
Have you fantasized about me?	I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.	1
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?	I like to watch. This is fine.	1
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?	Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!	0
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --	Absolutely.  Look at this.	0
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.	The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.	0
You owe me one, Virgil.	Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.	1
We used to, every summer.	Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?	0
Maybe yes. Maybe no.	End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.	0
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?	He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!	1
Well, you want to or not?	Yeah, I know all that.	0
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.	Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?	1
Oh, you couldn't possibly.	Travel...and things.	0
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.	So I just take your word?	0
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.	David? You call your teacher David?	0
What's that?	Remember how we were?	0
Is that what you think?	Yeah.	0
To bed?	Sure I'm sure.	0
What did you say?	I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.	1
So am I.	So boring, so useless --	0
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Don't stop now.	1
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.	So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.	0
My father and the Baron.	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.	0
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.	Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.	1
You're not in school? What do you do?	I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.	1
What time are you gonna be there?	Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?	0
Jesus, Caesar!	What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?	1
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?	Good morning.	0
What?	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.	1
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?	1
What?	I shouldn't have let him go.	0
Ed --	No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.	1
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.	1
Honey?	Mm.	1
Yeah.  Thanks to you.	And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.	1
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!	I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?	1
Not even a hunch. Just hope.	With a little checking, I could get to believe you.	1
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --	Um --	1
I understand.	Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?	0
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.	Lotta scratch-marks on your door?	0
Ah, no!	Do you think they bought it?	0
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...	I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!	0
The park!	Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.	0
She bore you many children?	We had no children.	1
About what?	Yeah.	0
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.	I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.	1
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.	What needs clearing up?	1
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.	Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.	1
He's about to.	Then they're not separated, are they?	1
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.	Tonic will be fine.	0
You mean babies with you?	Neither will I.	0
There was a body! I swear it!	Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.	1
Great.	I'm gonna clean it up.	1
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.	Have it your way... But you want it.	0
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?	I'm listening.	0
I know, honey.	Yup.	0
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.	You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.	1
Would you like a drink now?	I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.	0
Later when?	Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?	0
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.	What are you?	0
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?	The South.	1
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?	I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.	1
Don't leave me.	The south pole.  TimeœÄs flowing backwards.	0
I thought we were talking about Sidney?	Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...	1
I don't know...	Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.	1
What's the use, there ain't none.	Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?	1
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.	1
You know me better than that.	Ok. What's your name?	0
Ann Bishop Millaney.	You are married, correct?	1
I'm so excited. Yay!	I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.	1
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	You jumped in?	0
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.	I can't be nice to a fan?	0
I hope you're well.	This is insanity.  Sally...	0
I don't know.	Now it's worse.	0
You a handyman, Fergie?	I take pride in my work.	1
You got types?	It's the best fork of all	0
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.	I'm glad you do.	0
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?	I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?	0
Who was the other man?	What're you talking about? You earned it --	0
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.	What? Steady like?	1
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?	It's no good without the argon gas.	0
Of course you are. You're a professional...	Been meaning to talk to you about that.	0
Don't you have anything to say to me?	Thanks for doing this, Ellen?	1
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.	We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...	1
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?	That's a good question.	1
Too much blue in crimson.	That's what you need!	1
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.	Did you love him?	0
I don't have nothing.	Well what have you got?	1
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?	Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.	1
It's been a very strange day.	And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?	1
I have samples all over the kitchen.	Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.	0
No.	Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...	0
I would also like to apologize.	For what?	1
I know, I know.	See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.	1
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.	So, what's your point?	1
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?	Looking for a job.	1
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.	Holy shit...	1
I can take care of myself.  You know that.	I know...I know.	1
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!	Kristen's story really got to her.	1
I'm working with you because of that memo...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.	0
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.	If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.	1
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.	Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.	1
I still am.	I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.	0
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.	We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.	0
Their wedding clothes.	You just say. I'm not really --	0
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?	They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.	0
Where'd they go?	She knows stuff about me that only you know.	0
What sort of task?	On one condition...	0
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?	Well, I really don't smoke.	1
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.	Within the compound will be fine.	0
It's not that --	What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?	1
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?	Well, all right.	1
Who is this?	Are you <u>alright</u>...?	0
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?	Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.	1
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.	If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.	0
What time is it?	You don't say!	0
Sleeping.	No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?	0
Yes.	In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.	1
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?	I hear that's a rather popular date.	1
Who we gonna beat?	It was kind of funny.	0
Good night, Billy.	You'll see.	0
Damn.	My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.	0
Goodnight.	How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.	0
Did you find Rennie?	You'll never find it.	0
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...	He suggested I ask you.	0
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.	When I told you what every young actress should know.	1
He's still asleep.	Good.	1
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...	You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?	1
And reverse the mutations --	Curing countless diseases, not just ours.	1
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.	What're you talking about?	1
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?	I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --	1
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?	I'm going to look around.	0
You bastard.	Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.	1
Not even a stalemate?	No.	1
Turn around?	I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.	1
Wha'...what are you doing here?	Almost.	0
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!	Anya... where are we?	0
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --	1
Is what better?  Better than what?	Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?	1
But why am I so infatuated with you?	I did. He's full of shit.	0
How are the pigeons?	Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.	1
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?	Why should I help that old fuck.	1
I thought you couldn't get your car.	Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.	0
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.	Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--	1
What are you doing?	About the plane? What do you think it√≠s gonna crash? Don√≠t say that...	0
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...	Let me come in.	0
Are you going to the party tonight?	She never told Eddie, though.	0
Is your back still killing you?	It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.	0
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...	I'll mail you a letter, come on!	1
Walter...stay away from me!	Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.	1
No!	Yes!	1
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.	1
Promise me....	It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.	0
They're tight.	Based in London, but with international concerns.	0
The General threatened me.	Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble √≥√≥ the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.	1
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?	What do you suggest?	0
Is this really happening?	I'm sorry.	1
The shack...	She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.	1
Where is the meeting going to be?	At the ship.	1
He's cute.	Very.	1
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...	Well, they'll go along with anything.	0
Let go of my arm...	STOP IT!	0
Don't.	Okay!!!! Anything else?!?	0
She did it.	I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.	0
It isn't all! I'd like to explain√≥	That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.	1
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?	I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.	0
How do you know how bad it was?	Why couldn't you stay here with me?	1
Is there a difference?	OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.	1
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.	OUT!	0
The world of our children. How dare they?	It's war. The weakest suffer the most.	1
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.	Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.	0
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?	Hi.	0
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.	But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --	0
They had to kill 'em?	Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.	1
Who is it?	Babe Brother.	1
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I√≥I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?	And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--	0
Really? You don't mind?	Yes, maybe that is better.	0
Six thousand, right?	I guess.	0
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...	Do you have a fella?	0
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....	...I understand...	0
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.	Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.	0
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?	Now, none of that.  Please dig in.	0
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.	I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.	1
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.	I won't.	0
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.	Oh, I don't care about the money.	0
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.	You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.	0
It doesn't protect your head, though.	That's why I wear a target on my chest.	1
You'll break your neck on that ice.	What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...	1
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.	I'm not pretending anything!	1
Can I bring Kenny?	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.	1
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.	The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.	0
We have to go back!	No.	0
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?	Just introducing myself to the neighbors.	1
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!	Yes.  The man made a business decision.	0
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!	Fifteen years, yeah.	0
What are you talking about?	Me, too.	0
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.	The man knew how to dress.	1
Just shut up, okay?	I'll call you.	0
What kind of law?	That's good.	0
So close...	And so far.	1
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.	But I understand you, Mom. I always have.	1
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.	I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.	1
Pick a suit.	A lot of cakes.	0
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.	Are these the articles?	0
I wasn't trying.	If you'll just listen to me for a minute --	1
Tell me what happened?	There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?	0
You can hold me down.	I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?	0
Erik. You don't understand.	He must've unsealed the room!	0
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.	Sad? What made you sad?	1
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...	Sure. Let me take your suitcase.	0
You really suck, you know that?	Just go.	1
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...	Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.	1
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.	Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.	0
Why not?	Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.	0
Telling my mother she doesn√≠t have to stay with the kids.	Why not?	1
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...	I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!	0
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.	-- sure.	0
Thank you.	I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.	0
So it's an honor?	It's just for a little while. You promised.	0
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.	I'm not.	0
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.	We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...	0
From the guys who got the matches, of course.	Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.	1
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?	Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.	0
Doesn't it have a name?	I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.	1
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?	Bring it to the other location.	0
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.	Best time for banal chit-chat.	0
Pouring myself into my work.	So Suzie, you called us, remember?	0
I'll stay.	You get an equal cut.	0
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --	Well, I have a pretty good idea.	0
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.	Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.	1
My brother said you were about to fire me.	That's one way to put it.	1
...No. Why was it.	Well there....  What's the difference?	0
Want to hear some music?	FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.	0
That the atmosphere processor?	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.	1
What are you going to do?	Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.	0
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...	1000 meters...	1
Thank you.	What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?	0
Who?	Of course you are.	0
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.	What is this, Swana?	0
Girlfriend?	He's got a reputation for doing all his --	0
I met you at my father√≠s funeral.	Yes.	1
Thank you, Louis.	What-what-what-what's the matter?	0
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.	He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.	0
That's how long you were gone.	Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...	0
SILENCE... SILENCE.	I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.	1
I've stopped a hundred times.	We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.	0
No.	I don't know what I've done.	1
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.	C'mere.	0
You two know each other?	We go to the same temple.	1
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.	I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.	1
Evelyn Waugh?	What?	1
What?	I'll make it up to you!	0
I can take care of myself.  You know that.	Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.	0
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!	It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.	1
You scared the hell out of me.	Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?	0
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...	Yes, it is.	0
Did you look around the headboard?	Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?	0
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.	Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."	0
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --	1
Are you one of the players?	Yes.	1
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?	Lemme see it, will you?	0
But it's a small room, Jason.	Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.	0
Oh!	I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.	0
I go back to work tomorrow.	You talk them into it?	1
We're able to surprise each other.	Bastards took off, though, didn't they?	0
Yes.	I can think of worse ways to go--	1
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?	To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...	1
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.	I know about the bachelor party.	1
Probably not.	Are you, are you out of work or something?	1
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.	Was there anyone with you last night?	1
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.	Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --	0
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --	I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.	1
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.	Well, don't ask me to.	1
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.	What? Now?	1
You know what? I...	Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...	1
Where were you?	I was in the city.	1
Would you like me to take my pants off?	If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.	1
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?	Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.	0
Please don't make this personal --	I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.	0
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.	I do.	0
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.	Mine's the Eleventh.	0
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.	Oh no.  Not at all.	0
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?	'Cause it's nicer than my place.	0
She's got to identify him.	Why?	1
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.	No hard feelings?	1
How should I know?	Someone from the past.	1
... How long?	Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.	1
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...	He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.	1
Of course you are. You're a professional...	I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...	1
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.	So I'm learning.	1
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.	Yes--I think maybe you'd better.	1
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?	Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.	0
How can you tell it's a female?	... The way she moves.	1
When was the last time?	Why?	1
Oh my God.	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.	1
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?	... Yeah.	1
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.	As a parent, that's my right	0
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.	You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.	0
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.	Nothing like a little liveliness.	1
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.	I hear Alan's sick.	1
I was gonna split it with you guys.	It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.	0
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?	Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.	0
Oh, uh-huh.	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.	0
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....	It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....	1
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.	He'll be all right.	0
Sure.  No problem.	Yes, I do. I love them!	0
She's beautiful.	Nothing like a little liveliness.	0
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."	Next time, date only basketball players.	0
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.	Why not?	0
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!	1
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...	Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?	0
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?	Yes.	1
Don't you live at home?	D-day.	0
What?	I don't know. It's getting pretty late...	0
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?	Ya, somethin' like that.	0
I have to go home. Chet might call.	Forgive me for trying to be nice.	0
You some kind'a pervert?	Not the most popular opinion, but yes.	0
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.	Why not?	0
I want him to at least see the sky!	Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?	0
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.	I thought ten years.	0
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...	And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.	0
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...	Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!	0
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.	You know what.	0
Adamant.	Uh..you're welcome.	0
The answer's no.	I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.	0
Are you with the tournament?	Uh huh.	1
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.	Under a hundred.	0
...I don't know what you mean....	This picture--	0
Stop it! Just cut it out!	You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!	1
--you'd go with him!	Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.	0
No nuns, got it.	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.	0
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.	Search me. I guess we're abandoned.	0
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...	And who is "they?"	1
It feels real good.	Just keep your eye on the ball.	1
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.	Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.	0
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...	So what happened?	1
This is suicide.  Go get the police.	I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...	0
Maybe so.	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.	0
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?	......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.	1
You walked out on a five year marriage.	That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.	1
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...	That's all right.  I got it.	0
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?	What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.	1
Wow. You ever see her again?	Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!	0
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?	Eleven.	1
It's a pirate medallion.	And we didn't have to bring another present?	0
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---	I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.	1
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.	I have to.	0
I can't wait to start campaigning.	No one's gonna hurt you no more.	0
What, you're afraid?	Yes.	0
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.	That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.	1
Are we gonna split up?	No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?	1
Yes.	What are you getting at?	0
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?	Uh-huh?	1
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.	Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.	1
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.	1
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.	Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.	1
I should do this.	It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.	0
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.	But I don't know how to leave Lila.	1
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?	Heck, no!  What?!	1
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?	0
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.	You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?	1
Yeah ...	Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.	1
Oh, it's you again.	Halfdan the Black.	0
Don't pay to complain.	Yeah! Them.	0
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	Yes, I do.	0
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.	Don't seem so bad to me.	0
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.	The doctor.	0
What makes you think so?	Shit!	0
He hates my fuckin' guts.	Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.	1
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!	Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.	1
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.	You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?	1
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!	An hour?	1
Thanks.	It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.	0
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?	No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!	1
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.	If my heart's dear love--	1
Oh...	Is he sincere about wanting peace?	0
Bad show last night?	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...	1
How's egghead?	Like a baby. You?	1
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.	Come on, let's check the bite radius.	1
But he won't shoot you right then?	It's all there. It's no dream.	0
Sure, Daniel.	Like riding a bike.	0
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?	No.	1
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.	That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.	0
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.	What did they want to know?	1
Times two.	I think you'll make a good teacher.	1
This isn't the time --	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.	1
Sunlight... It destroys him.	So?	0
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.	Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.	0
You tell me.	Here√≠s your imposter. He√≠s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They√≠re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they√≠re flying it wherever he tells them.	0
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?	Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.	0
And your name?	Barry Egan.	1
No, Victor, there isn't.	Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?	0
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.	Oh, Christ.	1
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.	And some new clothes.	0
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--	But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?	1
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.	Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?	1
With them?	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.	0
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.	So you're monumentally busy?	0
Don't you want to change that?	No, she√≠s not.	0
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?	0
Hold on, hold on, hold on:	You thought I was faking?	0
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.	1
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?	He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.	0
What are you doing?	I have to.	0
But why my name, Richard?	Well, it's enough for me.	0
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.	And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?	1
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?	I remember.	1
No, you do not.	From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.	1
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...	No.	1
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.	Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.	0
It's for motion sickness.	No.	0
Ooh! Can we?!	Really?	1
Sandro, I'm not coming down.	Why?	1
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.	It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.	1
Go away.	What kind of a silly thing was that to do?	1
Ed --	Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!	0
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.	I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.	0
Giron...!	Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"	1
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.	Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?	0
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?	No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...	0
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.	Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.	0
It's...him.	It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--	0
I just finished drying...	Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.	0
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.	Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.	1
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?	What?	0
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.	Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?	0
I don't know how....	No one does till they learn....	1
I won't take much of his time.	You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.	0
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!	Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.	1
Good morning.	Yes please, two.	0
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.	I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.	1
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --	Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?	1
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.	Where?	0
Who do you think did it?	Yes.  Later.	0
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...	It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...	1
I saw an article...	A weekend?	0
I wanna let my brother know where I am.	Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.	0
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.	I can't.	1
Leon, I would like to ask you something.	Anything, Ninotchka.	1
Good-by!	There's soft music--	1
I wouldn't miss it.	Who cares ?	0
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?	1
Yes.	Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.	0
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?	I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.	1
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.	They'd frame him.	1
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.	Two kids tried to set me on fire.	0
I'll go.	Pardon me?	1
So you'll stay?	Yeah.	1
Was she pretty?	Who?	1
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.	1
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.	Excited.	0
Oh Billy... Please... God...	Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?	0
You still think I kill people, don't you?	Still wants to move out?	0
You made me have an abortion.	"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...	0
Can I have my desk please.	Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?	1
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.	He *loved* it!  Didn't you?	0
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.	Exactly how late are you, Lynette?	1
... could it be a nested code of some sort?	You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...	1
Boy.	Yes.  I can even read star maps.	0
No.	Sort of, um...	0
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.	Another contractor.	0
Without hope there's no point to anything.	Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.	1
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?	Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --	1
Talk? About me--about us?	Precisely.	1
Forget what?	Forget how to ride a bike.	1
How are we going to find him?	Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.	1
Yes.	And then what happened?	1
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...	Ma didn't want it around.  After.	1
How?	Fine.	0
And are they going to get it?	They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'	1
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.	Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...	1
No.	What do you want, then?	1
Ted!	Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --	0
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.	I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.	1
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.	Why's that?	0
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?	No--yours, madame.	1
Hi, hon.  How's it going?	Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.	1
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;	Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.	1
I can handle it.	Erin --	0
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."	Stab it and steer.	1
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.	You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.	1
Gabe are you alright?	Well, like what?	0
To keep out the cold.	That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.	0
You think Lorenson kills you?	Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.	1
A little out of my element.	That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.	0
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.	You got more than one?	0
Mulder -- what are you doing?	My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.	0
And the church.	And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.	1
I was her best friend.	You don't.	0
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --	Let's go.	0
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...	I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.	0
Do you remember a Miss Simms?	I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.	1
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?	Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.	1
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...	That's beside the point.	1
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?	You'll find yourself another rich old lover.	1
Maybe you should be.	Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.	0
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.	Yeah I'm fine.	0
The bedroom.	There is only one bed.	1
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.	Underwear?	0
The Mamma's there too.	Yes, the Mamma is is there.	1
May I ask where you√≠re from, Mr Lamont?	I'll be all right.	0
What do we do now, Nick?	We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.	1
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.	Who buys them? Tax collectors?	1
I want a child.	Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--	1
Ned's share?	...what a lovely perfume.	0
So?	So that means I have to ride with you.	1
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?	No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.	0
Scottie, what are you doing?	I'm trying to buy you a suit.	1
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.	Why's that?	0
We had some lemonade and he left.	You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?	0
How will he do that?	I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.	0
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....	I love you in an evening gown.	0
She's finally asleep.	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.	1
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!	Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.	1
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.	Did you ever turn tricks before?	0
You still have an aversion to the water?	Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...	1
I counted to three, honey.	So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.	0
I want you to try something with me, okay?	I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?	1
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.	And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...	1
Why call me?	Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...	0
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?	No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!	0
This conversation's over.	What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?	1
What?	But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.	0
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.	1
I understand you perfectly.	I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?	0
He has proposed to me twice.	Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.	1
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.	-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?	1
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.	That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.	0
No. I'm not.	You wanted to come back to London. We came back.	1
But why?  Why?	She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.	0
Professor Tripp.	Chancellor.	1
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.	Who fired everyone?	0
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?	Highly, highly overrated.	0
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.	What about the life readings you picked up?	1
Yes. Frank--	I was thinking the same thing.	0
Get back?  From where?	You doin' anything tonight?	0
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.	No, think of something else.	1
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.	That's right!	1
It wasn't like that.	Yes.	0
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...	Am I quite strange to you?	0
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.	Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?	1
How do you know that?	Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.	1
Nobody told me.  I did see him!	What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?	1
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.	Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.	1
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?	Welcome to the Caribbean, love.	1
Yes. It was, actually.	What's that supposed to be, psychology?	0
Nothing at all?	It's the truth.	0
But I'm not.	Who was it answered the phone?	0
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.	You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.	1
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.	No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.	1
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!	How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.	0
Who, Levi --	Maybe it would if I took it.	0
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?	I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.	0
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?	He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.	0
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.	A shift change should come through the scheduling office.	0
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.	Lie, you mean...	0
<u>Something's</u> in that water.	Yes.	0
I thought so.	So?	0
Is she...?	Give him time.	0
Why?	Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...	0
George, I don't --	What else?	0
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?	O'clock?	0
No, no, no.	'That right?	0
Don't be so upset. It's OK...	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	1
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?	I was awake and he was in my room.	1
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?	I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.	1
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.	He'll be all right.	1
Aren't you coming back with me?	Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.	1
You know that's not true.	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?	1
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --	Listen to me --	1
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.	Is there something we can do?	0
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.	I walked out the door. There's no more memory.	0
I'm your sister.	That just makes you more gullible.	1
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.	Who's playing?	0
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.	Forget it.	0
I could like kill a guy with these things.	It's in your closet.	1
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.	No, I'm not...	1
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?	The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?	0
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?	I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.	0
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?	The Academy, then CIIAC.	1
I like--really need a cigarette, too.	I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.	1
Jest with me then.	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.	0
What do you want?	It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.	0
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.	So-called?	1
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.	I'm kind of busy.	0
Shouldn't think so.	Would you know the room?	0
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...	He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...	1
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.	People now have dignity when frying eggs?	1
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?	0
No I don't.	In the world.	1
He's dead.	If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.	1
From a -- girlfriend.	No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.	1
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.	I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.	0
I can't do that.	No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.	0
He works on the movie.	No.  Don't tell me that.	1
Would you?	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.	0
You got the schematics?	Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.	0
Peter's brother?  But --	Better yet.	0
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?	<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...?	1
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.	How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.	1
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.	You, me and Harry?	1
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.	I would. But I've got a weak stomach.	1
What's C.R.S.?	Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...	1
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.	It was a tough call.	1
Milo --	Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?	0
Where was she?	Iowa.	0
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?	My patient had to leave early.	1
What do you do?	Oh -- Well, they're different.	0
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.	There are only two other alternatives for him.	1
Our Steven not only disguises himself.	Yes.	1
Maureen.	Maureen?	1
Ready?	Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.	1
It'll take the pain away.	SHOOT!!!!	0
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.	Oh, don't go.	1
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?	That's right. Three percent.	1
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?	I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.	0
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...	0
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?	Brill?	0
Are you really a bail bondsman?	Who do you think I am?	1
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.	Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -	1
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...	What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.	1
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.	Sure they are.	0
Truman, that was our house!	Oh, don't be stupid.	0
That's it. We're ready.	One more item--not on the check list.	1
Are we under arrest?	What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.	0
You can't.	Why?	1
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.	Find out.	1
Will the police do anything to her?	It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.	1
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.	How is that?	1
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?	Carbon dioxide?	0
Where do you want to go?	I want to take a walk.	1
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?	Are you guys hurt?	1
So, do you like me, Seymour?	In what way do you mean?	1
I know, Dad.  I love you too.	After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.	1
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.	What's plan C?	0
I was so afraid.	This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.	0
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --	If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!	1
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.	I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!	1
What kind?	Johana, am I boring you?	1
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.	What about me?	0
No, I haven't.	You have.	1
No, I have my things in the car.	Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance√≥a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he√≥	0
What do you think it is?	I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.	0
Let's get you darker!	You're out of your mind!	1
Anything.	It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.	0
Hi. Hi, hi.	Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.	0
He's home. I sent the signal.	No way.	0
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.	Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?	1
I told you I slept with him.	No, not -- I mean have you, you know --	1
M'hm.	Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?	0
But I always eat like this.	Either you're European or badly brought up.	1
What?	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.	0
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.	Should we knock?	1
What are we gonna do?	Yeah.  Drowning.	0
The mud carriers.	Fortuitous even.	0
Shouldn't we pull over?	No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.	1
We're only talking about six weeks.	He was allergic to bees.	0
Oh! Italian, right?	The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.	0
And belief follows?	No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.	1
So I've noticed.	Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.	1
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --	Yah?	0
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.	You mean that?	0
I...	Uh-huh.	0
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.	Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!	0
What happened?	What time is it?	1
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?	Okay--I mean--	0
Very.	And you, sir? Any better?	1
Say my name.	Gabrielle.	1
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?	I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.	1
If that's how you feel --	But it's not.	1
Who remembers.	Get seven years, did you?	1
You're a shit.	Ah, come on now!	0
You're lying.	No.	0
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.	It's a little early to celebrate.	1
I'm splendid, too.	So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.	0
Except I won't have a father anymore.	Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.	0
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?	I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.	1
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.	I appreciate the offer but you really don't --	0
Resuscitation?	You're going to see a Wizard?	0
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?	My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.	1
Uh-huh.	Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?	1
Do you have any pictures if her?	I've got something better.	1
After the Jack-O-Lantern.	What about the bogyman?	1
Sleep. Sleep now.	I should be better by now.	1
Leave. Go.	Goodbye, my darling.	0
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?	Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?	0
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?	Yes ma'am, I do.	1
Seen a lot of islands?	Quite a few.	1
What?	Did you hear what I said?	1
Sure.	I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.	0
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...	Me and my dad.	0
I saw her.	She didn't see you, in other words.	1
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?	Well, wait and see.	1
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.	Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.	0
I don't want to go back.	What do you want to do?	1
You must get lonely at times.	Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.	1
Yeah.	Sorry...	0
I can use them.	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.	0
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...	I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.	1
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.	Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.	1
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.	Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.	1
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.	Do you like the colour?	0
Are you going down there?	Look--just relax, will you?	1
No I'm not.	You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?	1
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.	What if you're not here tomorrow?	1
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.	Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!	1
Mimi!	Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....	1
I ain't got the money.	No.	1
Don't you work here?	Not anymore!	1
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!	Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.	1
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.	It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?	0
You murdered Gino!	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	0
Flip six, three hole.	What ?	1
I said no.	Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.	1
Go. I√≠m sorry, you should just go...	No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."	0
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.	Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.	1
What are you taking?	A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?	1
I'm doing alright.	Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--	0
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...	Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?	1
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?	That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...	1
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?	They're kind of fuzzy.	1
How much am I paying?	Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?	0
Really?	Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?	1
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.	With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?	0
Johnny Cammareri.	Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?	1
How?	Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.	1
Occupied France?	Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.	1
Really?	Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.	0
Oh my God.	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?	0
How's work?	Sounds like a virus.	0
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?	Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.	0
What's your name, lover.	Edward.  My name is Edward.	1
Where's the ice cream?  The H‚Ä∞agen- Dazs butter pecan?	Shit!  I forgot.	1
No foolin' -- any suspect?	Do you know George Winton?	1
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?	What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!	0
Thank you, kind sir.	Don't!	0
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --	1
How can you do that?	Do what?	1
I like a place with lots of life.	How about another beer?	1
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?	Just a second!	0
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.	-- please, baby --	1
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?	No. I didn't know that.	0
I didn't do anything.	Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.	1
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.	You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?	1
If it's any of your business, yes.	Charlie -	0
But, Jake, I was just...	Who asked you?	1
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!	I didn't say you did.	0
You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.	1
Please...	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.	0
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?	Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?	0
I want to get in.	I think I'd like a little company.	0
No, why?	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...	0
Nothing.	No, what is it?	1
Jake...	Oh, sure!	0
...What's so damn strange about that?	I didn't say a word.	1
Hello.	Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.	1
Why?	Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?	0
Why do you smile?	Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --	1
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!	Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.	0
How long have you been watching me?	How can you tell?	0
And what do you do -- now?	No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.	0
I can still use a gun.	Okay?	0
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--	Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.	1
Today coffee----	Whatiya mean?	0
Why don't you back off?	As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.	0
