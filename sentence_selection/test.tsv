Where?	Life.	1
Something like thirty-six.	WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?	1
Yes, darling.	Youíre judging me?! Oh, thatís a good one. Youíre lying to me, youíre lying to your family, and youíre lying to yourself. But youíre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?	0
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.	Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.	0
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?	I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...	1
Catch of the day.	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.	1
Italian.	Yeah.	0
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.	So whatís with the nickname?	1
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?	Not with your hairdresser.	1
And you're sure it was a woman?	Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.	0
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--	Kip's in trouble	0
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?	He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.	1
Okay, okay. Okay.	It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.	0
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.	George is going to open a shop.	1
I don't want them to arrest you.	I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.	0
To all those cons...	I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.	0
Don't worry. It's a test.	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.	1
Overnight.  What about just now?	I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.	0
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.	Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.	0
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?	I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...	0
Can you do that?	Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...	0
Who is this?	Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.	1
Off the boulevard.	Exactly.	1
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...	Would you settle for a husband?	0
But not you.	Do what?	0
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!	We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.	0
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.	What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.	1
She haven't even called you?	What?... What'd you do?	0
Hello?	Will you give me a break?	0
Peanuts?	Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.	1
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.	Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.	0
What did you think of the music?	No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.	0
The great communicator.	Sorry I hit Jackson.	1
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...	That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.	0
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.	Yeah.  Me, too.	1
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --	Absolutely.	0
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?	Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.	1
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.	You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?	1
Why?	Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.	0
I guess I do too.	You what?	1
Go away. Who are you --?	A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.	1
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.	But not now?	0
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?	That's okay, Mom.	1
Mm.	She never particularly cared for me.	0
What?	Dogs?	0
I have to be up early.	Me too.	1
When do we start?	Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?	1
Well?	Uh huh.	0
I have to.	Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?	0
No.	I guess that means it's okay.	0
He was a good man.	I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--	1
How do I look?	You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it óó I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.	0
Oh.  Oh yes.	I love you -- remember?	0
No.	Do...what.	0
That never stopped you before.	Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...	1
Sang.	Sang.	1
You have to say that.	That's true.	1
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?	Love.	1
I think, therefore I am.	Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.	0
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.	You saying you didn't ?	0
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.	All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.	0
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.	Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.	0
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.	Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.	1
STUFF.  Got a light?	Oh, sure.	0
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?	Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.	1
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?	I got nothing against--	0
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.	0
I could've sworn I heard something.	Door's locked. Nothing there.	1
What's all this pudding?	I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!	0
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.	So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?	1
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!	Wait up --  -- just wait up --	0
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...	Get him on the...	1
More than you think.	How do you know? Personal experience?	1
Yes, Gaston?	What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?	1
I know, I ...	Shari, I really like you...	1
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	What are they like? What are they about?	1
No, I don't belong here.	That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.	0
I want to stop taking those pills.	Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.	0
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?	No, you're his wife.	1
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.	Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.	1
Who have you been talking to?	What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?	1
I thought they came right past here óó	They do, but -- there are no lights out there ó- they'll just be shadows -ó	1
Johnny? Did you see Ben?	Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.	1
So tell me ... am I still an angel?	I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.	0
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.	Close!  The <u>other</u> one!	0
How are you getting along with Pinta?	Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?	0
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.	0
What does it look like?	No one else in here?	1
What?	It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.	1
You saw a lot in one night.	We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.	0
He wants... your "sister"...	Sally, for Christ's sake.	0
Valentin?	Good.  There.  Yes?	1
Goodnight.	See ya tomorrow.	1
What happened?	You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.	1
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.	We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.	1
Where've you been?	Rabbit hunting.	1
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	But what?	0
... What's going on?	I just want to see you as much as I can!	0
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?	Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.	1
Yeah.	Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.	0
It's just a puzzle box.	Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.	0
Like the last time.	I wasn't finished.	1
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --	Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...	1
Don't wake up Vada.	I won't.	1
Go away! You've spoilt it.	Oh, sorry I spoke.	1
Pardon?	No.	0
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.	When do you want me to start?	1
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --	-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.	1
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?	Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.	0
Biting you?	Pinching me!	1
Are you okay?	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.	0
To keep from being an old maid.	...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...	0
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.	But if you'll just give me...	1
Hello. Hello.	Who was it?	1
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.	Sure. Good-by.	0
I order you to find out where we are!	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.	1
Charles.	Why?	0
I thought you might want some hot coffee.	Thanks just the same.	1
Oh, good.	He won't do anything for me, but for you --	1
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.	D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...	0
Hi.  Are you... busy?	No.  Are you're leaving?	1
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.	Anything against zippers?	0
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.	It's fine.  Tell me what--	0
Pretty close?	Pretty close.	1
We're not gonna do anything.	Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...	0
Hi.	What?	0
...So what do you think?	I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.	1
1922. Why the kippers?	Man, you were a mess!	0
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	Of course.	1
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.	I'm glad we didn't.	1
But--	Can you follow simple directions?	1
Just an accident. Nothing.	Absolutely positive.	0
Are you...okay?	Business.	0
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.	How can you be sure?	0
Someone's following me.	It's not my line.	0
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.	Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?	0
I hereby acknowledge that...	And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.	1
Very much live.	One who's not a mutant.	0
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.	Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.	1
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?	Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.	1
Yeah.  I heard you.	Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?	0
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --	Erin, it's just a meeting.	1
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...	And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.	1
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.	Bring the money in and they follow it?	0
Peter, you're bleeding.	It's fine.  Tell me what--	1
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	It's not a compliment.	0
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.	Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.	1
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?	Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?	1
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.	Dying?	1
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.	No. I'd want a public phone.	0
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.	Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.	0
I'm helping George build his house.	Your Majesty --	0
Oh.	I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.	1
We're losing them.	Then get them out of there.	1
Why?	Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.	0
You mean a farm?	No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!	1
<u>Jake</u>...	He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!	1
What did you do that for?	You know any good criminal lawyers?	1
I'm sorry.	What do you want?	1
No, I can't tell you!	What?!	1
No.	Why not?	1
Hello, Rick.	It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!	0
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.	In radio we're different.	0
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?	Huh?	0
That's not why I called.	Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.	0
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--	And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?	0
Fine, then how many nights home is that?	I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.	0
Danny... what's the matter, hon?	Does she know about us?	0
You have tranquilizers?	I told you! I've got everything!	1
That's a strange angle.	Yes, very strange.	1
If I could have a little more room.	There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?	1
Moreover...	Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.	0
Forever.	Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?	1
William, you're not making sense.	[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.	1
The eight billion. From them to us.	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.	0
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!	They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.	1
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?	No one does till they learn....	0
What's wrong, Nathan?	Take off your God damn coat!	0
Could you do me a favour?	Thank you.	0
For an hour.	"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."	0
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?	No. I'll take you home.	0
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -	Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.	1
Kristina's fine.	Because.  I know where he is.	0
In my office?	No, please. I won't.	0
How about getting married?	No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...	0
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?	Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?	1
What happened to the power?	I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.	1
What about me?	Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.	0
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?	They scare me too sometimes.	0
Till this opens, not our wedding.	Wait, wait.  You told her about me?	0
I know he does.	Mama?	1
Tijuana.	For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...	0
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...	So they united.	1
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?	Thank you.	0
Yeah, well... me neither...	That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.	0
Who is she?	Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth wereó	0
So do I.  But for different reasons.	And I like you.	1
What's that?	I'm a puppeteer.	1
Pop?	Grandpa. My father. It's his.	1
Sporting events, yeah.	Why?	0
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.	What's wrong with It?	1
No.	You know I want to...	0
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.	Someone waiting for you?	0
You better not, Jeffrey.	Okay, okay.	1
The oscilloscope's already programmed.	It's no good without the argon gas.	1
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.	Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --	0
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.	Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....	0
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.	What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .	0
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.	No.  They all do.	1
It's Grace.	I have to...	0
Okay.	I can explain.	0
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.	But I'm always home by morning.	1
Sally?	Not the way I can.	0
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...	I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --	1
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.	Sure I do.	0
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?	-- what?	0
How do you know?	I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.	1
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.	I -- I found your jailer.	0
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.	Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?	1
What?  What is it?	You think you can do this, don't you?	0
I have some change!	Ram it up your ass!	1
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.	0
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?	Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...	1
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.	Why should I trust you?	0
Yesterday. It all looked normal.	About who?	0
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.	That's... pretty frightening.	1
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.	I see.	1
What are you doing here?	Emily, you -	0
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.	0
Do Peter Sellers again.	Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.	1
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.	I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...	0
What's the matter with you?	Nothing...nothing at all.	1
That's unkind.	Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?	1
Michael.	Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.	1
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.	Pleasant?	0
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.	...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.	1
Frank?  I'm frightened.	Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?	0
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...	He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.	0
Look at the size of it!	Oh god!	0
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.	I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--	1
You said that the last time.	What're you doing here anyway?	0
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.	Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.	0
A recent acquisition. Weíve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flatís been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.	Hah... What about Nathalie?	1
Where was she?	Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.	1
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?	"For"...?	0
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?	Sure.  Let's go.	1
I get ah - -	I know, it's very exciting.	1
Not like He punished me.	How old are you?	0
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?	Mrs. Mulwray?	1
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!	Why?	1
You're happy, aren't you?	La de da da...	1
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.	We...	1
Hey! Ethan!	Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.	0
It won't.	But if it does.	1
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --	It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.	1
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.	But it was horrible.	0
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!	I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.	1
It's cold.	It's 'pose to be cold.	1
I wasn't.	Your brother's here?	0
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.	You don't have a boyfriend?	0
Morning everybody.	Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...	0
Those creatures..!	You don't think Sam could've put it there?	0
Get that out of your trunk.	All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!	1
No. I was just... No.	I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.	1
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.	No.	0
--Torn down in the name of convenience--	--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.	1
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?	Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.	0
But we still haven't found Gustafson.	No... please...	0
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?	Everything is quite all right.	1
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...	It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.	1
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.	He's an undertaker.	0
What will your father say?	Yes.	0
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...	Disgusting.	0
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!	No.	0
Sailor, what are we gonna do?	Now I want you to do something for me.	0
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...	It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.	0
What are you doing?	I'm sorry?	1
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.	I'll pay.	0
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.	All right, darlin'.	1
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.	I've been working hard, getting paid.	1
I'm going now, Cole.	I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.	1
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.	Oh, no. She brought me my meals.	0
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.	Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.	1
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.	0
That's the boardwalk, Sam.	No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.	0
Pigsty.	Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.	1
I told you this was gonna happen.	That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.	0
What do you care about?	Apipoussan?	0
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.	I can't take shorthand.	1
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?	Yes, Ben - he is.	1
You think?	No it's not!	0
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,	No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...	1
Yes.	Very serious?	1
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.	Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.	0
Then what?	What's so special about it?	0
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.	It works a little.	1
Dade.	He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.	0
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.	0
But not over me?	Look!	0
I sing now?	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.	0
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.	1
The silver screen's loss is your gain.	No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.	0
With a family?	Yes. She had a husband and a son.	1
What are you gonna do?	I know.	0
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!	He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.	0
I mean really, deeply angry...	May I carry your package, Grace?	0
Right back at the start, right?	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?	0
But I don't understand --	Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --	1
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.	It is my sword and my shield, Macey.	1
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.	Of what?	1
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?	Forget it.	1
Shut the fuck up.	Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.	0
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.	But you didn't.  Why not?	0
Really? I thought he said it all the time.	That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.	1
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.	Just smile.	0
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.	Well, here you are.	1
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....	Where's my mother?	1
Yes?	I understand woman, damn!	0
Where did it come from?	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.	1
I'll never get close to anybody.	What's that?	0
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.	He looks like a giant tea bag.	1
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--	What's that?	1
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?	I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?	1
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?	I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.	0
No.	You're not?	1
He's mooing.	It's what I do. It's my job.	0
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.	Won't you join us?	0
What?	I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --	0
And you like them?	Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...	1
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.	But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?	0
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.	What does he know about the Highlands?	1
Does it look okay?	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.	0
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -	There's nothing to figure out.	0
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.	<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.	0
What's the matter now?	So we did.	0
She must have been in love with you.	Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.	1
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.	Can you come with me in my dreams?	1
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.	Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.	0
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.	Okay?	0
For the flat.	Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.	0
Ask a question, you get an answer!..	I sent them home. Go and call them.	0
Fuck you, Panes.	You see, that's worse.	1
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.	I'm not jealous of the dogs.	1
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?	I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.	1
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.	I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.	0
Then you came to a desert and mountains...	Yes.	1
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.	He's right beneath us.	0
You saw all that in one glimpse?	I'm simply quoting the law.	0
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.	I'm a robber.	0
Will you be joining us, soon?	Of course.	0
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.	No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?	0
Nothing.	I try not to expect you.	0
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.	I know you will.	1
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.	It's the truth.	1
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.	California, huh?	1
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...	Did he say who?	0
Well...	Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.	1
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.	What?  Jesus, tell me!	0
You OK out there?	Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.	1
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !	I can't help it.	1
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --	Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.	1
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.	You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.	1
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?	Light?	0
xxxxxx	xxxxxx	1
Why?	Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.	1
Ken.	I wish there was one I wanted.	0
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.	Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.	0
You like to open me, don't you?	I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.	0
His wife?	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.	0
Doesn't fit.	--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.	0
What do you mean?	Who?	0
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.	So?	0
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.	But I do.	1
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?	To him? He's a sick freak.	0
You don't understand shit.	Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?	1
I'm late.	Then?	0
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.	Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.	0
Enough of what?	I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?	1
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.	What's your plan of attack?	1
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.	Can't you tell?	1
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?	Great.	0
Have you told your family?	No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.	1
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.	No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.	1
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.	Darlin', Rose has got to go!	1
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.	Yes.	0
Yah, but -	We run a pretty tight ship here.	1
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.	Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!	0
I didn't know you were coming.	I was in the neighborhood.	1
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?	Three-cent stamp.	0
What?	...this close...	0
He's out of prison?	They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."	1
Okay. Yeah. What time?	Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!	0
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.	That's... good?	1
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.	It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.	1
What happened...?	Blockhead started it!	0
Like mother, like son....	My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....	1
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...	I understand -	1
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.	Thereís more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.	0
Older, sillier.	Mariette!	0
Oh, please.	Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.	0
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???	1
Chris --	I can't stay here.	1
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?	Nothing.	1
Ollie.	I think I'll read a little.	0
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...	Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.	0
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --	I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.	0
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.	What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.	1
You know how the Sisters are.	You training to be a nun or something?	1
Will you take me home?	What?	1
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.	Mock, mock, mock.	0
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.	0
He lied!	No sweetheart, you can't.	0
Really?	This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?	1
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.	Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.	1
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.	They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...	1
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?	Siam.	1
Do you love me?	I'd like to say it a thousand times.	0
Something happened to you.	Yeah?	1
Maybe Charles does.	I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.	1
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.	1
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.	Really? Care to make a wager on that?	1
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?	Yes, I am rather.	0
You want to dance?	Nurse!	0
I've always thought that myself.	Oh, yes.	1
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.	Hey.	1
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--	He was the real thing, right?	0
Go away.	Give me the bat.	1
C'mon, kids, let's go.	"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."	1
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.	You see, even the voice.	1
George.	Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.	0
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?	So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.	0
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.	No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.	0
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.	0
Then maybe you're ready.	I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --	0
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.	Yeah it was all just an accident.	0
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.	I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.	1
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.	I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...	1
Ed, I'm so happy for you.	Why?	0
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.	...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?	0
Nothing.	You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?	1
There's two of 'em, Lou!	Yah?	1
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.	That's astonishing. Sera, look...	1
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.	I guess this is a first for you.	0
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.	I'm scared...	0
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.	What?	0
Don't spend all day down there.	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.	1
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.	All right...	0
Yes.	Where?	0
No, no. I did.	It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.	0
They belong to the people.	I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!	1
Damn.	You alright?	1
Yes.	I had you transferred to Kigali.	1
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!	'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.	1
Thank heaven that's over!	Shut up!	0
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...	0
Are we going to die?	No, yes, it does...	0
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.	Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.	0
Do you really mean that?	I see that.	0
NO.	Doesn't matter.	0
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.	Okay, so maybe later.	1
Is Julia here?	Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.	1
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...	What?...	1
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.	Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.	1
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.	Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.	0
Here... In the park?	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.	0
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?	You were a lady in distress, weren't you?	0
What are you lookin' for?	Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.	0
Andy, the theater's that way!	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."	1
Benjamin -- do they know you?	Of course not.	1
There was a recipe on the back  --	What do you mean?	0
Hey.	Hey. You OK?	1
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?	0
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?	No more stalling, Captain.	1
You okay?	...I think so...You?	1
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.	It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.	1
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.	I can't leave the house?	0
Where could he have gone?	Maude?	0
I don't believe it.	That what he says. Right?	1
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.	For the purpose of what?	1
What are you after?	Must one always be after something?	1
What am I to do with the packages if...	Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."	0
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?	Why did you jump?	0
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.	Good night, Mama...	1
Don't talk too loud.	Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...	0
Don't touch me.	How is she?	0
Your view of what?	Yes, Courtney?	0
What's it about?	It's really not about anything.	1
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.	Why do you have to see him?	0
Do you want to take a session?	I just want to ask some questions.	1
So am I.	I'd a found you, Ma.	0
What is this?	Not yet.	0
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?	Ahh, I just wanna look nice.	1
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!	0
At least I'm open to new concepts!	And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?	1
'They won't.'	It's superb.	0
Are you my man?	Do you remember where you were?	0
Yes.	After what happened to us?	1
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.	Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?	1
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.	It's ok.	0
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.	In 76 years, me neither.	1
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"	I can't comment until I get paid.	0
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.	Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?	1
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.	But don't you remember?	1
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --	-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.	1
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.	No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.	1
Six months.	Dogs?	0
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.	Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.	0
Good morning, my lord!	Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!	1
No. You lost your way.	Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.	1
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?	Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.	0
It's just for a couple of months.	You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!	1
What?	Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.	0
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?	I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.	0
You tell me.	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	1
John, where are we g --	Oh Jesus.	0
Maybe I want to feel badly.	That doesn't make sense.	1
Vietnam?	Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.	0
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.	You was friends.	1
I should be going.	What?  How about a drink?	1
That's what you get flight pay for.	When're you going to see him again?	0
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.	So?	1
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...	Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.	0
Perfect.	And what happens then?	1
I told you this was a simple-minded play.	Ma didn't want it around.  After.	0
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--	I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.	1
Yes.	I got some hair stuff.	0
Hey, can I borrow this?	Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?	0
You met Basil Rathbone!	Why?	0
I don't take orders at all.	If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.	0
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?	The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.	0
Is your name Paul Benjamin?	What can I do for you?	1
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?	Is anyone having this...?	0
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?	I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.	1
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --	It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.	0
The winds are picking up.	On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?	1
Yes.	Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...	0
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?	No. What's the big deal?	1
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -	Why did you do this?	1
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.	You could do better.	1
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.	What about Jennifer Desiderio?	0
Yes.	Why?	1
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.	1
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...	Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.	0
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.	And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.	1
Really?	He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.	1
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.	How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.	0
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.	Want to know?	0
What for?	Bank robbery.	1
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.	Goodbye.	0
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.	0
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.	Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.	0
No.  I don't even know why I do it.	Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?	1
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.	1
Why haven't they brought us in yet?	I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.	1
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.	The chauffeur. He's watching.	1
Were any of them married?	I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.	0
Lower your voice!	What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?	1
I beg your pardon?	You did!	0
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.	I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.	0
I've had these dumb dreams lately.	I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.	0
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!	I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.	0
Santos... What's happenin' here?	Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.	1
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.	It's summer! You're kids! Go play!	1
So?	So, we get the mother, we get the boy.	1
Oh yes, of course.	There sure is.	0
What about your grandmother?	Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.	1
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.	Your boyfriend?	1
It's the bitterest of pills.	That's off now.	0
This is just... so...	And falling in love?	0
By the way, what's your name?	Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.	0
Alice is dead?	What are you saving for?	0
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.	Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.	0
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.	We did the decent thing.	0
I know about alcohol, John.	I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.	0
We'll explain the whole thing to them.	I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.	1
Walter.	It was my mother's.	1
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.	Left behind?	0
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...	It's just a nightmare.	0
Daddy, it's true.	Let me be the judge of that.	1
A dress.	Dress, huh?  What for?	1
Don't start.	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.	0
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.	Why?	0
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.	What are they like? What are they about?	0
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.	Just three people in a room this size? Whew!	0
I don't know	Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -	1
Is it pretty?	That's the reason.	0
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?	Was it you?	1
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.	You're mad. Why are you mad?	1
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...	How do you like it?	0
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.	He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.	0
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?	Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.	0
How was I? Tell me honestly.	And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?	0
Who?	Graham.	1
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.	Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.	0
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.	Let's do it.	0
What?  That's horrible!	Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.	0
Wanna try it from the top?	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?	1
Yes, Gaston?	You said --	0
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.	Don't get kinky here...	1
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...	Just go.  We can manage without you.	0
Yeah, right...	But where is my daddy!?	0
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!	It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.	0
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.	Really?	1
We're about an hour away.	I can't believe I slept.	1
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.	It wasn't supposed to happen like this.	0
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.	If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.	1
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.	As do I.	1
Let's keep it to business, shall we?	...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?	1
Who do you think I was talking to?	My secretary saw you with that boy.	1
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.	baby, please, please --	1
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?	It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?	0
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.	No, what is it?	0
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.	It can't be possible.	1
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.	Thank you.	1
Oh, my God!	What do I do?	1
How do I look?	Still my beautiful child.	1
That is the worst kind of paranoia.	Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.	1
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?	The Windmill.	0
It turned out to be cancer.	Wow.	1
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?	And your father was executed.	0
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.	A Carpet Cleaning Company?	0
I want this one, daddy.	Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.	1
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.	I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...	0
And what are you going to do?!	Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?	0
You know what I'm going to be?	What more proof do you need?	0
Dickie!	I'll go and see what's the matter.	1
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?	Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?	0
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...	Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?	1
Am I dead or not?	This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?	0
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.	Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.	0
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.	I'm okay. It's okay.	0
When do we start?	Your mother will be down in a few minutes.	0
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!	Picked his pocket, actually.	1
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.	No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-	0
Claire is your wife?	Lindenmeyer?	0
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.	What is that... wailing?	0
What happened?	Three times.  Powerful number.	1
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.	That's what I do.	1
None at this time, sir.	Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.	1
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.	What d'you mean?	0
Convene?	Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--	1
That slut!	Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?	1
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Let's get married.	0
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...	1
We must!	With no laser --	1
You mean my other self ...	Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?	1
What a day I've had!	Tired?	1
Michael...	To get on home.	0
Terrible, thank you.	What?	0
Who is it?	It's Barry.	1
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?	There was a review.	1
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.	During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.	1
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.	But this is different.  Go on blow,	0
If you're going to insult me --	I'm Sheriff Deeds--	0
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.	Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?	0
Bus hit him.	Fast.	1
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.	Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?	0
We have to have a long talk about all this.	Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.	0
This is going to give you nightmares.	I like this story.	1
I donít want to be safe!	Clockworks.	0
Bye Mrs. Sennett.	Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --	0
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --	I was just asking.  Are you all right?	1
Oh. I see.	But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.	0
Oh, Alvy, come on.	What'd you say?	0
Do you believe in astrology?	Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.	1
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?	Tell you what?	0
I told you where I was.	All night?	1
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?	Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.	1
He's right.	He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.	1
But you have treated me that way.	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.	0
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?	It's perfect.	1
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.	I could take after Dad, too.	0
Nice, Jack.  Youíre sweeping me off my feet.	What? You make me hot...	1
So you found Peter...	Lonesome?	0
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.	That simple, huh?	1
Why did you come back?	When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.	1
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.	But he's--	1
Well, are you? Are you queer?	... yeah.	1
Well, somet...	I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.	1
What are you doing here?	Alright.	0
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.	No, you don't understand.	1
She held that against you?	Apparently she was very disappointed.	1
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.	What do you mean, without him?	1
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....	There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?	0
It's 3+27 hundred	Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.	1
But this is a porno movie.	I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.	0
I must go.	Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...	1
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.	What happened to the walk and the nakedness?	1
Someone not his wife?	Ahh, maybe next summer.	0
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.	Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.	0
No, not that.	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?	0
Maybe you need to start.	Now don't that call for an extra!	0
Oh no.	Quietly, slow down, whoa --	0
Oh, I see, I see.	You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	1
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.	Sure!	1
Would you do me a favor?	You've thought of everything.	0
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!	It's too late now--it's *impossible*!	1
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?	Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...	1
From citizen high to citizen low.	I'll get her...	0
In a saloon?	Uh-huh.	0
Are we just going to go on sitting here?	He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?	1
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.	No! I want to talk about it now!	1
So are you.  Are you shaking?	No. Are you crazy?	1
Shut up.	Maybe we should just kiss.	0
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.	To my health.	1
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.	Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!	0
Can you turn off the game?	Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.	0
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.	Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.	0
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.	Can I talk to you?  When you're there.	0
You fell in love with her first.	I won't be needing these anymore.	0
Come on.	Wandering.	0
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.	Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.	1
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.	You mean with Malkovich?	1
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.	0
What are you doing with all these blueprints?	Good night, Eve.	0
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.	You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.	1
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.	Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.	0
Well... Yeah - okay.	Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!	0
I wish they had never met.	That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.	0
I'm not sure.	I knew when I first met you.	1
Yes.	In time she'll be what you are.	0
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?	Was it the bogyman?	0
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Wait, what happened to the tree?	1
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.	I suppose that's my fault.	1
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!	Are you all right?	0
Yes.	Their wedding clothes.	0
They're stragglin'.	His letters will keep.	1
What?	I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.	0
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.	Really. I want to know.	0
Uhh, no.	Have you been to any parties?	1
Well, aren't you excited?	I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.	0
Now who's being sarcastic?	When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.	1
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?	Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.	1
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.	Um-hm. Live sound.	0
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.	For what?	0
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...	What?	1
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?	Oh, I'm making investigations.	0
When?	You want to go back in?	1
Well done.	Thank you. Now, where were we?	1
It's beautiful.	Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.	0
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.	And you'd be my cousin?	0
What about your boy?	How come you keep askin'?	1
Want a bite?	You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?	0
Jill.	Jill.	1
Yeah, I guess you're right.	No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.	0
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.	I don't know.	0
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.	Sit down!	0
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?	1
Ha...	Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.	1
What?	The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them	0
I don't want to hear about her anymore.	Never.	1
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	I'm not hungry.	1
Do you want to hear it or not?	Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!	0
That's...a comfort to hear.	I have a problem.	1
Talking to me, dad?	Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.	0
What?	You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.	0
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.	You felt sad. What's your name?	1
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.	I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.	1
What brand'd she smoke?	Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.	1
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.	0
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.	I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?	0
Teh... Tehronne?	Tehronne? Tehronne done this?	1
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.	I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.	1
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.	You don't like me? You hate me?	0
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.	So you had a nightmare.	1
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.	That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.	1
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.	0
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?	From the air?	0
Guess you gotta go.	He's been dead for three months.	0
We'll never survive.	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.	1
Enough of what?	Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.	0
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!	No, Starla! No!	1
You keep the ten thousand pounds.	What ten thousand pounds?	1
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?	I'll take care of myself --	0
For what?	I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.	1
He still having parties?	He never stopped.	1
Sure I am. It's fun.	I just read it....	0
You've got to stop doing that?	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?	0
You want a drink?	We were going to get married. Are going to get married!	0
On what.  What makes you so certain.	You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.	0
Sure am.	That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.	1
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.	You got a suspect...	0
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.	Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --	1
Think this about money still, ya old fool?	But then I won't be able to see anything.	0
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.	Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!	1
Will this do?	Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.	1
GET OUT!	Don't cry.	1
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?	My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?	1
Burma!	Oh...	1
Oh yeah?	Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?	0
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?	Yes.	0
Great!	Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.	0
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.	Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?	0
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!	You're not selfish at all.	0
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.	Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.	1
Do you... remember me?	Mm-hm.	0
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.	You guys got busted. This is a great neck.	0
What is it?	Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.	1
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.	Yeah, well --	0
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?	No, 1995 is the past.	1
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.	Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.	1
Not unless you can fly.	Come again?	1
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?	Right 'cross the freeway.	1
Here's your class.	My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?	1
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!	The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.	0
There's nothing else here.	Fiendishly so.	0
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?	Please, Francie...	1
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.	We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.	1
Because if you do, I'll kill you!	I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.	0
No, sir. Not at all.	Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?	1
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."	Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.	0
What about this morning? Any developments?	Nothing would please me more.	0
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.	Was I?	1
Yeah.	Wow. I thought I was the only one.	1
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.	What about the "Roaring Twenties"Ö or "The 80's"?	0
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...	Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'	1
Oh.	She pay you much?	0
Doesn't it ever bother you?	-- and then walk out.	0
You... you... you mortal you!	Please...	1
That's too bad.	I just woke up. I'm sorry.	0
Thanks, honey.	And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.	0
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.	Tell 'em.	1
You're soaking.	Mmnn.	1
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.	That's a nice name.	0
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?	Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.	1
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --	Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.	0
You're not really serious about this, are you?	That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.	0
Boy, this is good!	I'm sorry that I became so upset.	1
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.	It's his work.	0
Where are they heading?	Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.	0
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?	You're back.	1
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.	It was a long time ago.	1
Suck my dick!	Shut up!	1
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.	So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.	0
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.	Gay movies.	0
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.	You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.	1
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?	Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'	0
Lenny, give them the tape.	What's the matter?	0
Because I know you're full of shit.	I brought these, but clearly...	0
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...	I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.	1
Luis is a despicable twit.	It's not mine either.	0
Would you like a drink?	Let me call you back...	0
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.	Then why do you want to go?	0
So that was your pudding?	That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!	0
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.	Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.	1
Huh.	Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?	1
No.	We're late to get to your mother.	1
What about?	You.	1
Makes no difference. Get him out!	Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.	0
You looking' for some company?	Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?	1
No, no way, I couldn't take that...	No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.	0
Yeah.	Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...	1
I never asked you to choose.	Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.	0
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?	He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!	1
From a -- girlfriend.	But what?	0
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.	No, I got time.	0
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.	Where's Anna?	0
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --	No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.	1
I remember.	Yes. You and I, Jessica.	0
But will he... ?	Your daddy will always love you.	1
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.	0
It's a flop house.	I was just kidding.	0
Excuse me?	Fun.	1
No.  Richard talked to his parents.	I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.	0
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.	Where am I supposed to eat?	0
Are you a private detective?	Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.	0
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.	[Beat] What?	1
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!	0
Jack...	Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.	0
And what?	Jen please ...	0
Logic indicates that is the case.	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?	0
Better believe it.	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.	0
I don't hear it anymore.	When I'm guest of honor?	0
The Big Boy did...?	That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	1
When did you get in?	Those are gifts.	0
What happened?	Remember the guy who cheated at the table?	1
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.	I hope so, too.	1
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?	Why were you given notice?	0
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.	Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.	0
Because he was scary, that's why.	Who was scary?	1
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.	Sounds fair.	1
Thank you.	Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?	0
Did he sound upset?	A little bit. Is that good or bad?	1
Norman?  Where's Norman?	By the bunks.	1
It's so... small.	Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.	1
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.	Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.	1
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?	Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.	1
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!	Go where? You can't get away from people like this.	0
My lord.	I have spoken with your father.	1
What!?!	It's all going to work.	0
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.	I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.	1
Five minutes.	When you were a little French girl?	0
Why not? I'm hungry.	Iím working on a new deal now...	0
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!	Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.	1
Yeah, well... me neither...	You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?	1
What do you do?  What are you doing here?	But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?	0
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.	1
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.	If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.	1
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways ó	Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.	1
Nah.	What you been up to?	1
No! Don't! Please!	Calm down, baby.	0
Thank you.	Maybe he likes older women.	0
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.	What has Artie to do with it.	0
But why? Why here?	Madeleine died here.	1
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?	I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.	1
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.	Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?	0
Why, Brad?	Yes.	0
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?	Just hangin' out.	1
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?	See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.	0
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?	Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?	1
He's setting me up to make a proposition.	I see.	1
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.	1
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.	Be more specific.	1
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.	Mm.	1
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.	No -- not this time.	1
M'hm.	You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.	1
Which is?	Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.	0
You married?	People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.	0
Oh no. I have no plans.	Well, isn't this a coincidence.	1
This I gotta see.	I molested little girls.	0
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.	Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.	0
What?	Raising the shields.	0
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.	What were you -- a child actress?	1
These THINGS... they want to take me --	A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.	0
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.	Huh?	1
I love you. Don't feel sick.	The hell you're not.	0
You're serious. You want to date again.	What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.	0
What!?	Very well. Thank you.	0
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.	I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.	1
Is this a joke?	No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.	1
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?	Really?	0
Diseases.	Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.	1
I don't want to talk any more.	Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --	1
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.	Not because you have to.	0
Big night coming up?	She may be later than you think...	0
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.	Yep.  Eloped.	0
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.	Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!	1
Where?	Oh yes?	0
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'	Dickhead?	0
I adore him.	The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.	1
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.	1
That headboard.	Nobody can hear it.	1
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.	Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.	1
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.	It's a great song.	0
Tonight?	Yes, my love?	0
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you	Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --	0
Anything?	I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.	0
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.	You want me to walk you?	1
Quien es? [Who is it?]	Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]	1
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!	That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?	1
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?	You wouldn't.	1
You coming back?	Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...	0
It's going to be a cozy weekend.	What is?	1
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.	Why didn't Birdson just say so?	1
Here.	Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?	0
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...	Good night, Eve.	0
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.	That's it?	1
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.	We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.	1
No.	I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?	0
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.	I just want to know where she's staying.	0
Why?	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.	0
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.	0
Alla puttanesca.	I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.	0
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.	Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.	1
Hey...	School's cancelled.	1
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --	What the hell is that?	0
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.	No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?	1
Frank --	Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...	0
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.	Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.	0
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."	Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?	0
Thank you.	You're welcome.	1
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?	"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"	0
So why's he do it?	He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.	0
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.	I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.	1
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...	What?	1
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.	Cool.	1
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?	I guess I probably used to when I was your age.	0
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.	I see she built a place up here by the river.	0
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.	That's what I like.	1
What do you mean?	With pay!	0
Yeah, well, don't let it get out	So what's your excuse?	1
I want to know. You tell me!	You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!	1
It's a starting place.	That's right...	0
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?	Watch and see.	1
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.	If you've lived a good life, fought well--	1
Promise you won't go inside.	But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.	0
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.	What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?	0
Think about your father. Your sister.	Hey, come here, Sob-sister!	0
Please!	Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!	1
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.	It's you ... it's you ...	0
Didn't you hear what I said?	I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.	1
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.	That doesn't make any sense.	1
Remember that.	I... I don't remember.	0
I don't want to talk about it...	But you don't know what happened.	1
You know it and I know it.	Oh!	0
No, no.	You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?	1
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?	Why not?	0
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.	What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.	0
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...	Yes.	1
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.	See you later.	1
Ten million --	Now you understand why I'm here.	1
I like plaits.	With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.	0
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...	I like to watch.	1
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.	Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.	0
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.	Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...	1

Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.	What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?	0
Iím sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	Like...ah...	0
Is it about Jacqueline?	No. She's no longer under my care.	1
...That's what we finally decided.	Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.	1
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.	What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?	0
Patrick? Is that you?	I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?	0
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.	Sorry. I was just getting something.	1
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?	Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...	1
Minor officials bother you, don't they?	Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?	1
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.	Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?	0
Why am I here? What happened?	You...  ...fell into the Bay.	1
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.	Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...	1
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...	I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.	0
Did not.	Get the hell out!	0
Wilson.	Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?	1
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.	And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...	0
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?	Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.	0
Huh?	He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.	1
...Don't get all...	...like it never even happened...	1
When will I see you again?	Sure.	0
There must be another way!	Projecting joy is not my job.	0
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.	Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.	0
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?	Not believing you.	0
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.	Or maybe crossing a river!	0
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.	Sorry.	1
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.	1
Nooo.  Is it your story?	No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?	1
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--	If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.	1
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.	Sssssh.	1
Pulse detectors.	Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?	0
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.	I love to get pie after a movie.	0
You better! Yes!	I will.	1
That's on time for Margo.	Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-	1
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.	You feelin' sick?	1
Remain calm.	So, where's "Weird Al"?	0
He needed my help.	Not because you were attracted to him?	1
What? What do you mean you --	Sue... look at your hands.	1
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --	0
You act like you never had peanut butter before --	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.	0

Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.	Really?	1
Yeah.	Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.	1
On tape?	No.	1

...What?	...I can't beat him.	1
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.	Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.	0
Have you finished?	When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womanís intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?	1
Uh huh.	Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.	1
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.	Ui-vol-i-tub!	1
If only it were that simple.	It is that simple.	1
No thanks.	Maybe it would if I took it.	1
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.	You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.	0
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.	What is a sip of coffee going to do?	1
Where you coming from?	All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.	1
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?	Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.	1
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.	All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.	1
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!	She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.	0
Can I go to the hospital with you?	I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.	1
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?	Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.	1
You're crazy --	Give me the fucking shooter!	1
Is it a planet?	How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?	0
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.	You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.	1
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.	What do you mean?	1
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.	1
Fine.	Bet you're happy to be working again.	1
I'm going to the dance.	What for?	1
Why is that?	We never would have had this conversation.	1
H'm?	Flares?	0
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?	No.	1
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.	Randall.	1
I understand the business reasons.	It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.	0
Benjamin -- what's happening?	Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.	0
I'm being a pain, huh?	I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.	0
What for?	Bianca did what?	0
Oh--yikes!	told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!	1
You know Chastity?	The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.	0
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.	Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.	0
Well, I need grass and so do you.	Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-	1
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!	You what?	1
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.	He ain't the only one.	1
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.	Why not? It was just money.	0
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.	So?	0
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.	All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?	1
Who is it?	Take the test again.	0
Ray wants him.	Yeah, sure.	0
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.	I don't understand.	1
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.	The same, alas.	0
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?	Well... the red bra.	0
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.	Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!	1

Okay.	Yes.	0
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?	"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."	1
At the Frankenstein Center.	Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"	0
The King pipeline.	Elektra would control it all.	1
Josie Grossie.	I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.	1

What's the population of Seville any idea?	How is she?	0

He'll barely be able to sit up.	That's the idea. Here we are.	1
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.	Who?	1
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.	Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....	0
No, sir.	I am.	0
I can't leave my job, George.	Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.	1
He knows you shattered his violin.	I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.	1
You had enough?	Do I look crazy?	0
What is it?	You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.	0
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."

Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.	They play pretty rough.	1

OK.	I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.	0
How do we start?	I turn on the camera. You start talking.	1
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.	One has nuthin' to do with the other.	1
Sure, why?	Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.	1
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.	Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --	1
Oh shit...	I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.	1

It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.	0
I'm saying, we're just friends.	I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.	1
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.	What about Ray?	1
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.	Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.	0
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!	Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.	0
Yes.	Yes, what?	1
What?	Get your kicks somewhere else.	1
No.	See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!	1
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?	We?	1
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.	But why now?	1
Did you find anything?	No, nothing at all.	1
It was a Ford, Benjamin.	Did you love him?	0
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.	That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.	1
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.	What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?	1
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.	And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.	1
Then I wasn't beautiful.	You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.	1
I am, really.	'My father's house has many mansions.'	0
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.	I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.	0

I see you read the book.	Like?	0
So you think we got 'em scared?	It's not going to hurt me to get up.	0
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?	Amy's been lying again.	1
My mom is gone.	Where is she?	1
I don't care. Something's going on.	You said a woman likes to be pursued.	0
Ted... you're not that far ahead.	Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.	0
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.	Yes, I guess I do.	1
Noooo!	Jesus Christ lady...	1
I'd use the word insane.	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.	1

Dance then?	Well, I want to...	0
Me? Oh, uh.  No.	Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?	1
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?	Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.	1
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...	You sat and talked until it was light...	1

You're American.	So are you.	1
This ain't gonna work.	Beloved wife...	0
Brad...	How was the beach?	0
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.	What ten thousand?	0
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...	Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?	0
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.	I just might do that.	1
You said you'd call my father.	Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.	1
We will.	Thanks, guys.	1
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...	I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--	0
Awaiting his arrival.	We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...	0
It's not hopeless...	I've got to take a piss.	0
What's funny?	No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.	0
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?	The car's not from our lot, ma'am.	1
With who?	Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?	0
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.	Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.	1
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?	I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?	0
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.	No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.	1
Do you want to?	Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.	1
Do you like it?	Ayuh.	0
My ticket?	I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.	0
How do I know if this is love ?	What am I scared of?	0
My car's in the garage.	Maybe another time.	1
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?	I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.	1
You're hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.	1
He only shot you once.	Huh?	1
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...	I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]	1
What do you need money for?	To bail Lisa out of jail.	1
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.	Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.	1
I like "godsend."	No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?	0
Huh?	Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.	0
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.	1
You've been cheating on me haven't you?	It's a comfortin' idea.	0
KingóKing Westley was in it.	Oh. Is that how you met him?	1
That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.	1
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.	I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--	1
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.	Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.	1
If... you have one.	I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.	0
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.	I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.	1
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?	What did you say?	0
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.	Hi. It's Nathan.	0
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?	It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!	1
I'm all wet.	What's wrong with that?	1
She's very beautiful.	Just an idea I had.	1
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?	I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?	1
I already said hello.	I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.	0
Why Memphis?	Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?	0
Oui. Perfect!	What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.	0
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.	Your father gave them to both of you.	0
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.	Great.	1
Well, why don't you?	Talk to you tomorrow.	0
That's okay. I --	I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --	1
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...	Okay, baby. Okay...	1
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.	Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?	1
I know what ability you're interested in.	Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.	1
Alright.	Alright?	1
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?	That depends.	1
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.	1
I'm glad you came.	And here I thought I was charming you.	0
No.  What's my cut?	She's still alive?	0
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	You could leave him.	0
So, now what?	Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.	1
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!	1
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.	What do you mean?	0
John?  What is it?	How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?	1
I knew you'd like him.	Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!	0
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?	More like other people putting their business in my nose.	1
Coming to bed?	Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.	1
You're not going to take your *suit* off!	No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!	1
State trooper?	Fallacy.	1
What's that?	It's important.	0
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -	But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.	1
Oh, that's too bad.	Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.	1
He works for Mr. Eddy.	What's he do?	1
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?	1
but do you know that for sure without -	It's fine.  Tell me what--	0
I guess you're new around here.	Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.	0
Bullshit.	I swear to God.	1
Everybody's rich.	He's good-looking.	1
What's that?	Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.	0
What's that?	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--	0
Just be yourself.	Always good advice.	1
KipÖ I -	I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.	1
LET ME GO!	You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.	1
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.	Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--	1
Do I have to?	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?	0
Neo, how did you do that?	Do what?	1
Thank you.	Yes...	0
I guess you're new around here.	Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.	1
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.	Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.	0
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!	Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.	1
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.	I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.	0
He's not the same as when I met him.	No.	0
You were late.	Where have they gone?	0
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.	Where are they?	1
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...	That's not true...	1
The teddy bear?	High tech. I like the sound of that.	0
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.	And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?	1
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.	I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.	1
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.	I may have said perhaps...	0
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?	You fuckin' whore!	1
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?	Why was Data assigned?	0
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?	Basic.  Hmmm.	0
He's through fighting.  Look at him.	When?	0
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.	Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.	0
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.	I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?	0
Oh God, that stuff stinks.	Oh, did he?  What did he say?	0
Are you alright?	It's you ... it's you ...	1
Thanks.	So tell me, how's it going?	1
Put your arms around me.	What?...	0
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!	I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.	0
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --	Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!	0
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?	To him.	0
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.	1
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.	In a word? Lucrative.	1
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.	Vada, this is an adult writing class.	1
Just don't... I've got a headache.	Yeah?	1
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?	When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.	0
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.	Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.	0
What is it now?	Don't ask.	1
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.	Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.	0
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.	Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.	1
I've been working double shifts.	It's not me?	0
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.	Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.	0
Pretty shallow of you.	That's me.	1
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?	Well...	0
Well, ain't that the truth...	Yes. It is.	1
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.	I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.	1
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.	Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.	0
You don't remember me, do you?	It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.	1
Max...	What...what about your script?  So what's it about?	0
The TV didn't work.	What Hotel are you staying at?	1
I wasn't asleep!!	What a break...	1
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....	Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.	0
Musclehead?	Well, let's get going.	0
"We"?  You and...	Yes Esther.	0
Pigsty.	Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.	0
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.	Me. It's Eddie.	0
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?	About NOT raping you...	0
Listen, you are witnessing genius!	As Charlie Steinway is my witness.	0
Chopped liver?	No thanks.	1
You wish.	Let's take a look.	0
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.	Hi, honey.	0
Late?	Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?	1
Try not to be late because kids donít like to be the last one picked up.	Got it.  Good tip.	1
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.	Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.	1
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.	Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?	1
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?	You saved my life in alot of ways.	1
You just ask them questions?	Yes.	1
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.	M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?	1
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?	What makes you say that?	1
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --	That's not what I mean...	0
Caesar, what are you going to do?	You're upset, that's alright.	0
Oh, uh-huh.	Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.	1
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?	-- how? --	0
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	I thought so.	0
Don't let me dis...I'll just...	What do you mean?	0
Get -- the -- bug -- off!	Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!	1
Am I not safe enough with you, John?	How...how do you know?	0
Not bad, Chris.	Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?	1
He wants to kill you?	Yes.	1
Well - ?	Here.	0
...Milo?	I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.	0
He could always make me laugh.	We did the decent thing.	1
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?	Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...	1
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --	I'm not sure.	0
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?	Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?	0
What right? Do you want me to tell you?	Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?	1
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.	I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.	1
Think I could have them back?	How do we do that?	1
Dewey?	There's nothing. I'm coming down.	1
Joe, I can't look at you any more.	My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.	0
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.	Where's his father?	1
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.	0
Hello, Ted.  You look well.	So do you.	1
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?	Yes, sure.	1
I couldn't help it óó I loved him.	One... two... three.  You are now awake.	1
Yeah.  All over.	Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.	1
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?	Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...	1
Well this is a cozy breakfast.	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.	1
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.	Gotta go, Mom.	0
What are you researching?	I'm writing a book.	1
Miller...	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?	0
A miracle. Well, that's news.	I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.	0
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.	We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?	0
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?	Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.	0
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.	What are you doing here?	0
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'dó get into bad company.	Yes, she is.	0
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.	"Yet."	1
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."	He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?	1
This is our first "date" date.	Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.	0
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.	There's some kind of gristle in it, though.	1
But, but, but, "they" would find out.	Who would find out?	1
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."	That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!	0
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.	No sweetheart, you can't.	1
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.	That isn't the way it works.	1
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.	I'm following you and David, if you-	0
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!	I do, Jill.	0
I'm saying no--and thank you.	What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?	0
What are his symptoms?	Alone.	0
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?	Oh my God.	1
I'll get the book.	No. There's nothing new.	1
Uh-huh.	Is he black?	1
Dinner.  Don't be angry.	You first.	0
Is she pretty?	He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.	0
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.	Sometimes which?	0
What did he say?	I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.	0
You're cold.	El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...	0
Yes!	Were you present when all these things took place?	1
Promise you won't tell Brad.	Cross my heart and hope to die.	1
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob ó Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.	1
Are there any special instructions?	I think it could be fun.	0
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --	What's this, how did this happen?	1
Oh! Italian, right?	Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?	1
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.	I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?	0
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?	0
Are you okay?	Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.	0
What's wrong.	I'll remember that. What do you do?	0
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!	Just tell a little white lie?	1
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?	I'll bring it back.	0
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!	Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.	0
What are you doing here?!	Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.	0
I'm scared I'm slipping back.	Ryan's novel?	0
These formations.  They're dried --	Birdshit?	1
<u>Jack</u>!	Me?  Sure I do.	0
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?	1
He thinks it could be made into something.	Into what? A lampshade?	1
Don't tell me --	I... You're not going to understand this.	0
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...	I will if you want to.	1
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?	1
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.	Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.	0
You1re leaving, too?	So am I.  Just trying to get by.	0
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.	There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.	0
You were very nervous.	Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...	0
It isn't working any more, David.	I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.	1
Okay.	Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY	1
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...	No. It's a lot further than that.	1
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...	Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?	1
Really.	Didn't get it.	1
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.	I guess I'm a little paranoid.	0
David --	It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.	1
Alla puttanesca.	Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.	1
Uh-huh . . .	I guess we get what we pay for, huh?	0
To keep from being an old maid.	You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.	1
Mr. Jefferson Carver?	Please, call me Mordechai.	1
What do you mean? You've never been there.	It's just my heart.	0
They sure liked them devilled eggs.	I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.	0
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.	Don't talk about Elaine?	0
Here.	My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.	0
I'm sorry.	I know.	1
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.	Really?	1
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!	They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.	1
-- Yes.	Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.	1
But the setup's there. It's there now.	Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.	0
Jeffrey Wigand...	Jeffrey...	1
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.	I dunno.	1
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.	Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.	0
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.	No, Kelly, I don't want to...	0
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...	Thank you, Trubshaw ...	1
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!	I never said it was!	1
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.	Is it a what?	0
What is it...?	You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.	0
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?	Stuffed and baking.	0
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.	What do you want me to say?	0
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...	Could they be the miners?	1
What do you want, Melvin?	Were you asleep?	1
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Why?	0
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?	I don't want you to forgive me.	0
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.	I sent the message to Max.  WeÌre on for tomorrow.	0
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.	I am committed. I love you.	1
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?	They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.	1
Donít do this, Jack... But he continues...	I worship you.	0
You think he's for real?	He's from another world.	1
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.	I'll take care of that.	1
... yeah, then, but...	So...?	1
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.	I'll getcha a piece.	0
Where were you?	Detroit.	1
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.	All right.  She smiles back.	1
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.	I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?	1
What's the title?	"The Day After Yesterday."	1
Your a real philosopher.	You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.	0
Is the trial date set?	May 11th.	1
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?	It worked, didn't it?	0
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.	0
Is that customary?	[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.	0
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special	We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.	1
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.	Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...	1
Still looking.	I changed my life today. What did you do?	1
Adam, where are you?	What's going on, Cynthia?	1
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?	Mommy, please don't call me that.	0
To do what?	I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.	1
My head is throbbing.	Oh, you got a headache!	1
Where... can I stay?	Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.	0
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...	Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.	1
You know her?	You are the Princess.	0
Take her.	Who did?  Mrs. Feur?	0
Do you?	No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.	0
We are the choices we've made, Robert.	TO HELL WITH YOU!	1
They're practically on us . . .	If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.	0
What's wrong?  Tell me.	We can't talk about it on the phone.	1
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.	You know.	1
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.	No. It's all about that night, isn't it?	0
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.	I'm not the One.	1
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.	Where you goin'?	1
-- no, it'll help me, really --	Oh yeah.	0
You're late. Very late.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.	1
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!	I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.	1
Good. You're just what I need right now.	I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.	0
The what?	Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?	0
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.	That's not all of it.	0
'Please remember that Dr. Furtw‰ngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.	1
Go ahead.	Sandy?	1
He can pilot?	Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.	1
You sure have.	So long.	1
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.	And you never cried -	1
Of course I am.	We'll cover it later.	0
Did you make any change in this room?	I do.	0
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.	Good, just making sure.	0
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!	Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!	0
Okay.  So he was tall?	Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.	0
It's for motion sickness.	Valdomet.	1
How was that?	I wouldn't be caught dead in that.	0
Give me a ride?	Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.	0
The staff donít know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnít take any more...	Plenty of pep, too.	0
Eat your fish.	Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.	1
'82.	No.	0
I don't fuckin' cook.	What?	0
Would you like to wring my little neck?	I'd love it!	1
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.	So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?	1
What can you see?	You are beautiful!	1
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?	I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...	1
What's wrong?	Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.	0
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.	Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.	1
Huh?	I just saw a man walk out of your room.	1
You know what my dad will do to you?	You have a stunt bottom?	0
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.	Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.	0
If you want to.	They believe in the 'TULIP.'	0
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."	Ok.	0
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.	I'd sooner wait outside.	1
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?	What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.	0
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.	Lothos.	1
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.	You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."	0
How do you think.	Fry 'em.	0
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.	Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...	0
Can I see you again?	Certainly not.	1
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.	What are you saving for?	1
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?	Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.	0
Eight o'clock?	What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --	1
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...	That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.	0
The most wonderful thing happened -	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.	0
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!	Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?	1
I know, but that was before.	Sure. Any time.	0
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!	No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --	1
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.	I don't know how two brothers can be so different.	1
Rain.	And a little ice.	1
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...	What?	0
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.	Good.  How are you?	0
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.	Okay.	1
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?	Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?	0
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...	It wasn't much of a letter...	1
Don't do this to me....	It's gonna be hot today.	0
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!	Sure.	0
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?	Do they have drinks?	1
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.	When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.	1
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?	As soon as you get dressed.	1
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.	Mary - I - excuse meó	1
You always get what you want?	I don't know yet.	1
I already explained about that.	And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?	1
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.	Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!	0
Why not?	You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.	1
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.	Pleasant?	0
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.	I should have known.	1
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.	Yes?	1
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.	Okay.  What's the second thing?	1
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.	And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.	0
No way... GET OUT!!!	Show her.	0
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?	No, uh...	0
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."	You're serious?	1
You never told us you grew up on a farm.	Underwear?	0
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?	How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?	1
He came to kill us.	I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.	0
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.	That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?	1
Yeah.	Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?	0
You're distracting me. Go away.	I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.	1
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.	They don't scare me any more.	0
0 my god.	Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.	0
Much further?	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.	1
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.	Didn't know you cared so much.	1
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!	1
You're so famous now.	Come, Claudia...	0
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.	As for example, what?	1
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?	Hitch-hiking.	1
Yes, it does.	You mean you have finished the whole investigation?	1
Look at her face. A real bitch.	She looked good then.	1
There is?	For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...	1
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?	I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.	1
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.	Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.	0
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.	1
I will. How's Shelly?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.	0
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!	Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.	0
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.	Well, anyway... Sorry.	0
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.	Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?	0
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...	You don't look like a college girl.	0
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.	In every way.	0
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?	Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.	1
Let the law --	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.	1
What's the larger experiment?	It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.	1
Crony indeed!	You can get out.	1
Okay, darling.	You'd say if you mind?	1
What?	He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?	1
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.	She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.	0
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.	Yes, of course.	0
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?	I have no wife.	1
... I don't get it done often.	Whew.	1
My father's the preacher.	Jesus.	0
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?	The charades.	0
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	1
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!	You won't die, Rose.	1
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?	Page 87.  "I could never read that far."	0
Have you seen it?	No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.	1
But no one in particular.	He'll be all right.	0
You think Tran killed her?	How did you find me?	0
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.	It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.	0
Radio said negative five.	Negative five?	1
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.	Right.  Thatís a major oversight...  So if Iím Kate...I canít really afford the finer things, my husbandís career is a crushing disappointment to me, Iím trapped in suburbia...	0
He didn't come!	I'm here!	1
These are not the kind of movies I go to.	Well, I don't follow movies too much...	1
Like Freddy.	Heather, has there been another call?	1
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?	Something's making that music.	1
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.	We all came from Africa, supposedly.	0
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...	I'd hardly describe It that way ó- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.	0
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -	It's war. The weakest suffer the most.	0
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.	Yeah?	0
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...	Like what?	0
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...	Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?	1
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?	Okay.	0
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?	Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.	0
Parker -ó stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot youóó	If you're gonna do it, better do it now.	1
Yes.	I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."	1
Yes.	Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!	1
Hello?	Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?	0
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?	Of course.	1
It never crossed your mind?	Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.	0
You can't do that.	Well --	0
Excuse me. Excuse me!	You talking to me?	1
To coincidence.	There's a casino in this hotel.	1
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.	Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!	0
Don't be too hard on him.	If you like 'em like that.	0
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!	Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!	0
I'm okay--I can walk.	What about your friendly cop?	0
She insulted me!	If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.	0
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.	What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?	0
They're coming!	Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.	1
I don't know.	What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.	1
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?	Is that right?	1
Why?	Why what?	1
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!	1
You know how to waltz??	Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!	0
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?	1
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.	Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.	0
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.	To do what?	1
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?	Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.	0
George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?	1
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?	What'd he get you?	0
Well I don't!	Whaddya mean?	0
I don't remember.	Where are you from.	1
My husband is a good man.	But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--	1
What's happening to me?	Done.	0
Where? I don't see a thing.	A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...	0
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.	That suits you.	1
You're unbelievable.	Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.	1
Why are you talking like that?	Pumpkin?	0
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.	You wrote his scripts for him?	0
Just stay away from me, okay?	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?	1
What does this guy want?	I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.	0
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.	Oh, no.	1
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.	When?	1
Is that what you call it? "Real"?	At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.	1
In ten words or less?	Yeah.	1
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?	Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?	0
She...killed Burke Dennings.	What?	1
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.	WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?	0
No.	Did you talk to Corey?	1
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...	It goes very fast.	0
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!	I'm her father.	0
No, I'm not playing this game.	That's astonishing. Sera, look...	0
Are they paying you for all this?	No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.	0
Your help?  What are you talking about?	Let's get married.	0
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.	1
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.	Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?	0
How do you know?	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.	0
I'm sorry...I....	There's nothing to be sorry about.	1
Then what good is he?	Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?	1
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.	Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.	0
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.	You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.	0
And it's all over now.	Yes.	1
Moreover...	Moreover...	1
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?	I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.	1
Oui.	That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.	1
Ted...	Yes?	1
That's too bad.	What ?	0
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.	Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.	1
How long's he staying for?	Search me. I guess we're abandoned.	1
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!	0
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?	Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.	1
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?	You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?	1
That's a picture of me in Japan.	What --	0
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.	Should throw a great weight into the balance...	0
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.	There are worse things than vampires out there.	1
Stuff it, man!	Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.	1
Pouring myself into my work.	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.	1
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?	It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...	0
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.	Hi. Did you have a nice swim?	0
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.	I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.	1
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.	At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.	1
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?	Why?	0
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?	It's not really something I think about.	1
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.	Hey-yo.	1
Of course I knew.	It just slipped your mind.	1
Well, does it make sense to you?	It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.	1
So you were looking for a new challenge.	You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.	0
Be careful....	Why?	0
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.	Claire.	0
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.	Where's Lombardo?	0
Honey... you all right?	I donít know...	0
Maybe we could try it this way.	This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?	0
350 pounds.	No.	0
Okay.	Fan works.	0
Iris.	Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...	0
And now, drum roll please...	Hope youíre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.	1
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.	No!  They're still on their way.	0
Don't let's talk about it.	Nope. We're safe.	0
I'm here with you.	What night? What do you mean?	0
You followed me. I can't believe it!	I didn't follow you!	1
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.	Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...	1
Don't ask.	I wasn't gonna --	1
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.	By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?	1
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...	Short range scan.	1
It's only 7:30.	We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.	1
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?	She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?	0
Oh, yeah.	Well, let's do it.	1
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.	I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?	0
Did he say anything?	It's not important good night.	0
3:30 I guess.	The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?	0
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?	That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.	0
I trust you.	I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...	1
When did you get back?	Why donít you ask when I left the Mondrian?	1
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.	Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.	0
I don't believe this.	Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!	0
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?	Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.	1
That's God's way!	What about tonight?	0
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?	Come on, I have something for you.	0
Hi, again.  Sorry about...	No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.	1
See! I knew you had it all under control.	Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --	0
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.	That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?	0
That's past -- that's over and done with...	Why would you care?	0
No.	I run him off.	0
It's so blue.	And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.	1
...I don't know.	Yes?	0
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?	What would you like? Texas?	1
None of your business.  God.	Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?	0
I'll see you there.	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!	0
I'll take a chance.	Go for it.	1
What are we going to do?	The War is Over.	1
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.	You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.	0
Has he asked to see the book yet?	Yes.	1
Oh, good. Okay.	I'm cool.	1
What's that?	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.	1
But you're not enrolled.	No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.	1
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.	Maybe deMille is shooting.	1
Thank you?	For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.	1
Where is he?	Zip.	0
What?  You know him?	It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.	1
Why don't you help us?	Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.	1
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?	You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.	1
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?	Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?	0
A night on the town instead of under it?	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.	1
That was -- different.	Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --	0
You should stay.	I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...	1
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?	No one else knows	0
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?	Right. Okay. Good.	0
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.	Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.	0
They won't believe us.	I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.	1
Oh, Jesus...	When did you first find out he was alive?	0
One.  In case...	Don't even say it.	1
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.	1
Alexander... I know you.	Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --	1
I'll just boost the doses.	She's right.	0
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.	So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.	1
I do.	Anything?	0
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!	Let's make a deal.  You shut up.	0
...Who is this?	Except for that.	0
Let me go now, you'll make me late.	That'd be great.	0
...Weíre turning in circles.	And you still havenít told me why you sent me after Friedman.	1
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.	You were plenty scared that night in the car.	1
Nine years?	Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.	1
Yeah.	I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.	0
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.	How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.	0
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.	I'm busy.	1
You don't?	Don't come back, not tonight, not again --	0
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.	You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!	0
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.	Then you won't make it.	1
A thousand times good night! Exit, above	I just don't think we have the right to ...	0
We made it.  Neil, we made it!	This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?	1
That slut!	No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....	0
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.	We need to find a way to make me part of it.	0
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?	What was I gonna say?	0
Always the lawyer.	Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."	1
It seems right to us.	I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.	0
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?	"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.	1
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.	Now, Aim --	0
Burt Reynolds.	I see that.	0
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!	Yah.	1
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.	Bullshit.	1
Yes.  But do you know?	Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.	1
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.	Exactly.	0
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.	Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...	1
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.	Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.	0
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	One of my few virtues is discretion.	0
No.	When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.	0
What happened?	I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.	1
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...	....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...	1
Are you sure?	You don't believe me, see for yourself.	1
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?	Usually.	1
What happened to him?	Yeah.	0
You're putting me in a difficult position.	I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.	1
How?	Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.	1
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?	For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.	1
I know.  Where are you Adam?	You think I'd really drink that?	0
Can I come?	It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.	1
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.	I'm sorry.	0
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.	It is?	0
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.	1
You will not hurt him?	Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?	1
What?	Try me.	0
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?	It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!	1
Lyndon Johnson?	There's nothing to explain	0
Huh?  Will? Is that you?	It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...	1
What?	You know what we want.	0
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?	Nothing.	0
You haven't told me everything.	Oh Christ. Julia...	0
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	1
But I'll have cocktails with you.	If anyone can help, HE can.	0
Alan Stanwyk.	Charmed.	1
Have you been noticing anything strange?	No, why?	1
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.	I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.	0
...What's so damn strange about that?	Well, thank you, Mary.	0
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.	Do you go to school?	1
Yes. Yes.	What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.	1
No idea who. No idea why ...	Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...	1
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?	What?	0
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...	0
No?	It's okay.	0
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.	I know what it means.	1

Three days. Are you hungry?	Three days? I must be.	1
Separate bedrooms?	Yes.	1
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!	Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.	0
Learning was important?	Am I home?	0
Did I miss something?	Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--	1
It doesn't bother me either.	Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.	1
I don't want you to let go.	Maybe I won't.	1

Yes.	Take my advice, don't buy any...	0
I'm going inside.	What are you talking about?	1
You're not a stalker or anything, right?	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.	1
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.	Except for that.	1
No.	I wasn't making fun of you.	0
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!	Incredible similarity.	0
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.	I don't know, I just feel it.	0
Hey guys.	Heddo Jeth-ica.	1

You are comin back, ain't ya?	We could introduce them. They might hit it off.	0
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.	I'm not that sick.	1
I'll be right back.	I'll wait here.	1
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?	Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.	0
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--	Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.	0
He wants to see your map.	I'm almost done.	1

You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --	She will succeed.	0
Whatever you say.	Did you tell Joe to behave?	1

Should I?	You better not sing that song.	0
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?	Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.	1
Really??	You live a fabulous life, Robin.	0
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.	I know what junk is.	0
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.	You saw all the reports, Beth!	0
Who?	Run!	0
It's a pirate medallion.	It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.	1
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.	I don't really like your friends either.	1

Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.	It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --	1
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.	I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.	1
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.	Is it gone?	0
Oh, this is Betty.	Nice to meet you, Betty.	1
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.	You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???	0
There's got to be a flashlight.	It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.	0
And you expect me to come over, just like that.	If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.	1
I'm heading out of town.	You see that moon last night?	0
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.	What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?	1
He liked to laugh.	Where are you going?	0
It's our anniversary, Panes.	Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?	0
Why do I feel I neednít answer that?	It'll just be a few days.	0
Don't come any closer.	What?	0
But I'm scared Telly.	What novel did you read.	0

Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.	please, what is it, please --	0
I have a headache.	Bad?	1
Anything I might know about?	Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.	1
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.	Let us decide that.	0
Mmm, needs a little something.	And General Savitzky.	0
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---	I know. Funerals.	0

I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.	Okay, honey, I'll see you later.	1
Stella.	Paden.	1
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.	Sure.  Did you see the others?	0
Didn't get much sleep.	Answer them and quit kicking me!	0
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.	I've never run across one like that.	1
Our adopted land...	...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...	1
Alice is dead?	No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.	1
Then you know where Jacqueline is?	Trouble. Why?	0
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?	No.  I'm not going near him.	1
What are you babbling about, psycho?	Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.	0
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.	You still haven't answered my question.	1
Tomorrow.	I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.	1
WE are over.	Tell me.	0
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?	Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.	0
That word again! I don't even know what it means...	It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!	1
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.	What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.	1
What are you doing here?	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?	1
Are you a bad boy?	We can look into that.	0
I don't understand.	Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!	1
I thought you were tired of your business?	I'm just tired in general.	1
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.	Yes -- I do understand.	1
There's heat coming the door.	Hold on a minute.	0
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.	Is he working?	1
Yeah.	Maybe we can study together or something.	1
Charlie...?	I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.	0
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!	Wait!  When can I see you again?	1
What kind of people?	Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.	1
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.	There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.	1
Why?	I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.	0
It's different with men.	Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.	0
What's the use, there ain't none.	Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!	0
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?	Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!	0
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?	No dog.	1
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!	Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.	1
What happened?	Let him go. Let him take it all.	0
George...	Why not?	0
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.	Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at tható	1
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.	Yes, Maxine, yes.	1
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.	I can't do that.	1
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!	Great. How??	1
A boy?	Well--yeah, I guess--	0
Could I speak to you in private?	Uh, yes. Of course. After you.	1
I just wanted to say hello.	Eight.  Size eight.	0
He said that my hand felt good.	I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?	0
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...	Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.	0
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.	Well, he owns things.	0
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...	Yeah.	0
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.	No, no, see, you, you don't understand.	1
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...	Worked in a watch factory?	1
Where would I go?	It's my bit for the community.	0
Stop the car!	Let us out!	1
Were they trying to kill you?					*	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?	0
You're just going to lock the store like that?	I'm going... I'm going.	0
Dan -- what do we do now?	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --	1
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -	Are you crazy?	0
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?	You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!	0
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.	But you knew about this.	1
Hiding?	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.	1
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.	What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.	1
Are you alright?	I said I'm a dying man!	0
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.	Mine too.	0
Um-hum ...	No -- they don't.	0
Oh, yeah.	Oh, sorry.	1
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.	The pages filled in?	1
You're not serious.	True enough.	0
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.	They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>	1
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.	And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?	1
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.	Give me an example.	1
What are you doing?	Poor Cathy --	0
The Cockatoo Inn.	The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?	1
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?	What?	1
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.	What is wrong with us?... We have everything.	0
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.	As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.	1
Yeah.	I've got to leave Malkovich.	0
Our kind of women?	No.	0
You're not at the center.	I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.	1
Don't look.	I... have... to.	1
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.	Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.	1
And I said I would never leave you.	Nah, accommodation address.	0
Ben?	Sorry.	1
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.	Let's go see them.	1
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.	1
Annie goes to a great school.	Iím talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...	1
I'd like to get out of here.	Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.	1
Yes.	I run a temp agency.	1
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.	It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.	0
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?	W-w-whatta you mean?	1
Why you have to go out there.	I don't have to. I want to.	1
I don't think you know what you're talking about.	Uh-huh.	1
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.	I always thought it was nothing but red.	1
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?	Yes.	0
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.	Who asked you?	0
You know women normally change five times more than men.	You get that off the screen?	1
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.	Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.	0
Just one minute...	Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.	0
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.	I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.	1
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.	My air isn't... I'm coming back.	1
Neither can I.	I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?	0
Dickie, my God!	You say that like it's a bad thing.	0
This sort of thing!	Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?	1
Jason.. Can you hear me?	Yes. Yes, I'm here!	1
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.	I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.	0
"Frenzy".	Yes I know.	1
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?	1
Well, that's good news, my boy.	I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.	0
What makes you think things will be any different this time?	I'll be switched!...	0
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.	That's a shame.	0
Did you pork her Harry?	No.  But I wanted to.	1
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --	Well, you sure do a good imitation.	0
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.	Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.	0
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.	How'd you get this number?	1
What?	I'm giving you a chance to walk away.	0
You're not so old yourself!	You wanted to come back to London. We came back.	0
No scars?	How about it?	0
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.	What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?	0
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.	True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?	1
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!	You done?	1
This is how you make dinosaurs?	Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!	0
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.	Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.	0
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.	We definitely want it to have junk.	0
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.	A parting gift from the Empire.	1
Twenty thousand dollars.	Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'	0
I don't think so.	It's okay. It's a cop hangout.	1
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?	Get seven years, did you?	0
You're talking like a drunk.	That's what I am.	1
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.	No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?	0
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.	If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.	1
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.	Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.	1
In the living room...	And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?	0
Shoes?	You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.	0
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...	So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?	0
Philip!  The senior partner?	His secretary just confirmed.	1
Read it.	Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?	0
What are you going to do?	It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.	0
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!	As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.	0
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?	They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.	0
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.	What's gonna happen?	1
Guilt?	Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.	0
They're acting very strange suddenly.	When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.	0
You want to see...	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!	0
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.	Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.	0
Gasparilla?	He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.	1
I don't hear it anymore.	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.	1
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.	You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?	0
Would you?	Would I?!! Why I oughta...	1
And I don't even know your full name.	They know what--this fella looks like?	0
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!	No...  NO!	1
Yeah.	I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.	1
Where are they?	I'm not sure.	1
Did you hear what I said?	The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.	0
That I am...	Then you're crazy.	1
Do I sit or stand?	Whichever you prefer.	1
Woman friends, too?	I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.	1
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!	I'm really sorry!	1
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!	You're right -- I am a coward.	1
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.	Where did this come from?	0
How long does this go on?	I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...	1
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.	No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --	1
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.	I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.	0
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.	Thank you, Eve.	1
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.	1
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.	Get in bed.	1
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why canít you go back there?	The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.	1
Another satisfied client?	Another satisfied client's wife.	1
Like I would have art in my suitcase.	I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...	0
Oh yes, of course.	Do you like me better?	1
Your mallard?	Yah.	1
Yeah.	Oh, I would love to hear it.	1
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?	Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.	1
Hello, Stew.	Hello, Hank. How are you?	1
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"	Where am I supposed to eat?	0
Niece?	Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.	1
I was sent here by my country to fight you.	I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."	0
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.	I'm sure you're not.	0
Hi.	The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.	0
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.	HARRY Dunne.	1
Wow!  What was that all about?	I suppose so.	0
You leave the kid alone.	A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--	1
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.	I have to go back to Birmingham.	0
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."	Seemed, not was.	0
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?	C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.	1
Do you have the suspect in custody?	Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.	1
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?	All my model planes.	0
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?	0
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...	It's a novel.	1
Yeah.	Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.	0
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.	Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!	0
Oh, it's so soft.	It's nice isn't it?	1
You've heard this story before?	This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?	0
Why is she leaving me?	Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...	0
I'll need that.	No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.	1
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.	What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.	0
Did you lose something?	Anything, Ninotchka.	0
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?	That's him, but... he's not here.	1
No.	Do we *have* to?	1
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.	Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.	1
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...	Go to hell.	1
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.	Was it reasonable?	1
Early, just think...	Shut your mouth.	1
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.	That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?	0
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?	Dance?	0
I won't have you fighting over me.	Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --	0
It's bad.	Do you know who was brought in for questioning?	0
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?	Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.	0
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.	Finally came to your senses, huh?	1
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...	Keep tasting...	1
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.	You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.	0
What are we gonna do?	We have to destroy him.	1
A franc for your thoughts.	In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.	1
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.	I could get promoted right out of here.	0
I promise.	No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.	0
You're afraid of germs?	Of course.	0
Now I become custody of police department?	She's left the room before. She always came back.	0
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.	That's the word...preoccupied.	1
What Kids?  Who went out?	All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.	1
So what went wrong?	I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.	1
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?	The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?	0
WHAT?	If I marry you my mother will die.	1
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?	Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?	0
What?...WHAT!?	I think.	0
But ... you did it before!  Last time --	Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.	0
Is this a joke?	You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?	0
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?	Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?	1
Oh, ha, ha, ha.	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!	1
I understand.	Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -ó you're off to work.	1
Who's your decorator?	What?	0
C'esc ma tete. This is my head	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.	1
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?	I was thinking the same thing.	0
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.	I'm not angry it's just	0
Yeeees?	And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.	1
Who, Levi --	Childs.	1
- - shut up.	But it was horrible.	0
How do you know?	It must of been a convincing letter.	0
Well, you certainly had a good look around.	Everything is quite all right.	0
Leon could still have hung himself.	Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Heíd never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.	1
We're from different worlds.	Yes -- that --	0
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?	I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.	0
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.	Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.	1
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?	....Hi.....	0
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --	I don't want to be just your friend --	1
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!	Oh - I'll get it!	1
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.	That's right.	1
He knows I do not love him.	But could I just tell you this one thing?	0
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.	That's Carlotta Valdes.	0
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.	You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.	0
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?	Behind you.	0
What are you doing?	I missed you.	1
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.	I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.	0
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?	Exactly. 10.30 --	1
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.	You don't pick your brother.	1
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.	Why?	1
Am I right?	I can see that. Sure.	1
Right.	Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.	1
Monica and Ryan.	Rose.	1
Make up your mind.	What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.	1
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.	Don't seem so bad to me.	1
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.	I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.	0
... I was dreaming ...	Something good?	1
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.	Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?	0
A certain weakness.	No. Any idea which channel he's on?	0
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --	Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.	0
Nice left you got there, jerk.	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.	1
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.	As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.	1
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?	I dunno.  Just being weird.	1
No.	What's got into you?	0
Here.  Ti amo.	Ti amo.	1
Are you coming...?	No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?	1
Me too.	Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.	1
But...	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.	0
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -	Stanzi!	1
You need to believe in something besides yourself.	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?	0
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?	We'll be back tonight.	1
How the hell do you find me anyway?	Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?	1
Ask him.	What if I told you he did this to me?	1
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...	Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.	0
What's Cao Ben?	How old are you?	1
But they'd still get the idea, right?	You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?	1
How's the trout?	Right here!	0
Okay, who's the jerk?	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....	1
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.	Aren't we all.	1
Tell me about the kids.	Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.	0
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.	Yeah, geography.	0
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.	Pest control, gotta do your apartment.	0
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?	It would have been really embarrassing!	1
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.	I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.	1
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?	You got a point there...	0
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...	That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.	1
I don't understand --	Did you say rape her?	1
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.	"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."	0
Who?	I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.	0
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.	Do you always say 'no' to everything?	0
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.	I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.	1
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.	I came back 'cause you were here.	0
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.	That's not my mission.	1
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.	Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.	1
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.	1
Why? Who are you?	I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?	1
... yes.	Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...	0
It's Skip, for you.	Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...	1
I have a headache. You have a headache?	No, I don't have one.	1
Who?	Rose, I don't --	1
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.	I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.	1
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?	Not for the weekend.  For the summer.	0
Seven-fifty.	When?	0
Jason.. Can you hear me?	Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?	0
What other issue is there, Sid?	My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.	1
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!	Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!	1
Margo hasn't done badly by it.	Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?	1
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.	Small moves, Captain, small moves.	0
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.	Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?	1
You think this is all a joke?	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?	1
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.	I don't need your help.	0
What do you mean, different?	The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.	1
Why?	Why?	0
Eight, six, and four.	Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!	1
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.	She never particularly cared for me.	1
Um... that's very relaxing.	Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.	1
Must I hear this?	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.	1
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?	Trust me on it.	0
This is where you live?	You bet.	1
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.	What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.	0
Well...no, but --	No.	0
Are you learning how to play it?	Yes? I'm trying.	1
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!	You are, you are my only connection to the world!	1
I can't....I can't....	Here. Make it easy on you.	1
It's nine o'clock.	That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"	1
She's finally asleep.	Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.	0
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?	That's up to Pilgrim.	1
What?!	Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?	0
I don't want to go back.	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.	0
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.	Do you have to swear all the time?	1
What?	The doctor said you were having sex.	1
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.	For who?  The fish?	1
Great.	I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?	1
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?	You came up here looking for the portal?	0
July.	July?!	1
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.	I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.	1
Yes, aren't you?	No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?	1
I want to nail you ass.	I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...	0
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?	I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.	1
You know carpentry?	I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.	1
You're a moron, you know that?	Yeah.	1
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....	There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....	1
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.	Didja tell 'em anything else?	1
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.	I... I blacked out.	0
Well!	I buy them flowers.	0
It's not your house --	You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!	1
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.	Look, I don't want a --	0
Oh.	By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.	0
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.	You sound as if you hate it.	0
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."	Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!	1
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.	Doing what?	0
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!	I wrote that.	1
Epps.	You just shoot at something?	1
You have a dog? What kind?	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.	1
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!	No kiddin'.	1
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.	It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....	1
Ich said you left.	There was a change in plans.	1
No.	Please! I need your help.	0
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?	Oh, no problem. It can wait.	0
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.	1
Wanna go?	Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.	0
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?	Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.	0
Greg.	Am I quite strange to you?	0
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.	DeJesus...It's got him.	0
I want to be had.	I think of you and the "boy" all the time.	1
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."	I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.	1
Touchy, touchy.	Not you too	0
Yes -- all right --	There has to be something that we can do.	0
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.	When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...	0
You're hurt.	Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.	1
Hello.	Hello.	1
It isn't any better.	Where's June today?	1
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.	No?	0
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.	He's got some fucked up friends.	0
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.	I don't like Katrina.	1
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.	I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.	1
Falling.	Oh. Is that how you met him?	0
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?	I'm going to talk to you.	1
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.	Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.	1
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.	That doesn't hurt.	1
Excuse me?	How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?	0
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.	But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.	0
How do you do it? Every night?	I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?	0
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!	Both.	1
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Cameron.	1
C'mon Lloyd.	Absolutely.  Look at this.	0

We should live together.	Sure.	0
Yeah?	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?	0
That-that wonít do. Thatís not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thatís the way...	Iím finished here and Iím tired, Emily. You shouldnít be here. Now donít make it worse.	1
That never stopped you before.	Go where?	0
Why do you say that?	Like you said-she snowballed him.	1
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.	Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.	1
How was your tour?	Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --	0
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.	It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?	0
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.	Chancellor.	0
I donít know. Everyoneís dead...	They may be right.	0
Mr. Henslowe?	One more. Smile. One more.	0
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.	Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.	1

I mean it or I wouldn't say it.	Remember how we were?	0
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.	He can't manifest.	0
Did you --	Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.	0
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.	I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.	1
Terrible, thank you.	Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?	1
There's a name from the past.	What did you say!	0
Are you in love with someone else?	My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.	1
I think she'll like this very much.	What do you think?	0
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.	You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-	0
She still is.	And are you here to berate me for making her that way?	1
A tooth?	A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.	1
Could you bring it up?	Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.	0
Yes, yes it is!	Great.	0
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...	Subtlety?	1

...I can't do it, Wally...	Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?	1
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."	And what would you say...	0
What is wrong with you?	About NOT raping you...	0
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.	We stick in each others craw.	1
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?	I could shore use some. Thank ye.	1
No it isn't.  You can't help me.	I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.	0
You sure?	All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.	0
What rate?	Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.	0
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.	0

Piss off!	I didn't --	0
Why... I donít know what youíre talking about.	Yes.	0
So. Anything else?	He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.	0
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.	He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.	1
But, I'm mean.	Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?	0
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.	I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.	1

I know where he goes.	I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.	1
You really believe that?	Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.	1
Why?	We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.	1
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.	No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?	1
You described the exact contents of my purse.	Really?	0
How fast does that go?	It goes very fast.	1

You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.	Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.	1
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.	That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.	0
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.	So why'd you give up ball?	1
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.	I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.	0
Ever been tempted?	The way they move, they way they smell --	0
I havenít been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.	Funerals arenít exactly memorable.	1
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.	Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!	1

Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?	Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.	1
Are you sure?	I'm sure.  He's dead.	1
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.	Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.	1
No!	But I wasn't sure you'd come.	0
Why would you do a thing like --	You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.	1
Is she...alright?	A literary feud. Quite normal.	0
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.	There's something black in the green part of your eye.	0
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.	It's a diet thing?	1
What does your gut say?	Youíre too good for him.	1
Uh ...	In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.	1
Since grade school.	That's a long time.	1
Of course.	I think she's pretty, Mommy.	0
I knew it!	Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...	0
Does you mother still work?	I was thinking Alice Cooper.	0
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?	Byrd's dead.	0
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.	You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.	1
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.	Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?	0
No!  Never!	I see the help -- judgement call.	0
Three.	Great. How old are they?	1
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.	0
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.	Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?	1
Five, seven, and nine--	Yes!  Now don't worry!	1
Were you with Jamie?	Yeah.	1
It's undamaged?	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.	1
Yes.	Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl Tható"	1
Don't hurt him...	Hot dogs?	0
Would this be easier for you in the dark?	Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.	1
She left the fucking gate open.	Well he can't have gone far.	1
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."	Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"	1
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.	Really?	0
But why Egypt?	Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!	0
-- hey! --	-- ten.	1
That's a big comfort to me.	I could be, too.	1
No.  What's wrong with the front?	Me neither.	0
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.	1
How do you know that?	I don't know, I just feel it.	1
Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.	1
Goodbye!  See you!	You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.	0
Mr. Kessler?	It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?	0
No...	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?	0
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...	Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...	1
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.	Tough day?	1
So, do you play the piano?	Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--	1
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.	Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.	1
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.	Of course I do.	0
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.	Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.	0
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.	Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?	0
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.	He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.	1
I want to meet them.	We'll do that.	1
What's the matter with her?	Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.	1
Yes.	Then you go into the foyer.	1
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!	So where would we go?	1
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.	Enh.	0
Why? What have you been thinking about?	How to die, mostly.	1
What is it?	My brother, Frank.	1
Maybe we should give it some time...	Yeah.	0
And this is Helen Carter.	I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.	1
I want to be alone.	But it's light in there now.	0
John...	Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.	0
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.	Okay.	0
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.	Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?	0
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?	Very good...	1
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.	He what?	1
What?	You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...	1
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.	Because ... I have to relax.	1
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?	Last time I didn't.	1
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.	We?	0
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!	Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.	0
Oh, is that what caused it?	In aid of what?	0
I don't know.  What are they?	I found them in your file box.	1
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?	Who'd steal her body?	0
WHAT ARE YOU-	Would you tell me if you had?	0
You're not really serious about this, are you?	All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.	1
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?	Tell me.	1
He's... he's dead.	No he ain't. He went South yesterday.	1
How can you say it?	She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.	0
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.	No dog.	1
Tell me.	I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -	1
Squids?	"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."	1
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?	No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.	0
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.	It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?	0
Why, what'd you hear?	What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.	0
My pimp.	You have a pimp?	1
Uh oh --	No, I'm alone.	0
That's repulsive.	They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.	0
You mean -- break in?	Can't you understand me?	0
About three months before I met you.	Why?	1
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	But I don't play anything.	1
Who the hell is that?	<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>	1
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...	I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.	0
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?	Did you hear what he sang?	0
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.	Oh Marge.	1
Barely.	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?	1
I'm leavin' the place to John.	I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.	0
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	She's there? What's she doing there?	0
I want to stop taking those pills.	I wish you wouldn't.	1
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?	I don't trust that chatterbox.	1
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.	Check it out.	0
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.	Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.	1
Do you love your father?	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.	1
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.	Okay. So what's your name today?	1
Hi.	Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?	0
You knew he was coming.	No.	1
No, I want my cut!	Oh?	0
You did this? To yourself?	I thought you wasn't comin'.	0
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.	I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.	1
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?	That's why I think it's time for us to --	0
Oh.	Ask Simon.	0
What are you doing?	Pretend we're just another couple.	1
About me!	Haven't you opened it?	0
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!	So what?	0
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --	Not exactly.	0
What shit, honey?	You don't want to hear about it.	1
What does it look like?	Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.	1
I will be in just a minute.	The picture starts at eight-fifty.	1
What is it, a surprise?	That's right...	1
Huh! Really? Hotels?	Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!	0
Why 're you doing this?	It's anti-nature.	0
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.	I thought she was dead. For sure.	0
There's a list.	Really?	1
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!	1
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....	Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.	0
Here's a nice place.	Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.	1
Oh. What's happening about the opera?	You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.	0
And what?	Did you?	1
You're weird.	I'm sorry.	1
The plutonium is missing.  Theyíve taken the core!	Then itís no longer a bomb?	1
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.	Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.	1
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."	I'm tempted.	0
Is that Cristaile?	We'll move in Sunday.	0
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--	Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--	1
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?	Little ones.	0
There wasn't any way to explain it.	Yeah.	1
Why don't you start with me?	You're not them.	1
Sit... and spin.	Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?	1
What are you doing?	Lucy'd kill me if she knew.	1
It won't. I trust him.	You trust him.	1
...Yes.	Without me.	1
And I don't even know your full name.	Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.	1
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.	Yeah. Good bye.	1
How'd you know I wouldn't?	'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.	1
I forgot the napkins.	And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?	1
Those, over there, there.	You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.	0
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."	Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?	0
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?	Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?	1
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.	What do you mean by that?	1
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?	Shh!	0
Vomit?	Hear what?	0
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.	I'll heal.	0
It's Charlie!	Yeah.	0
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?	No.	1
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!	Talking while kissing.	0
Bobby? Are you all right?	I busted my leg!	1
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	We're not married <u>yet</u>.	0
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.	Yeah, I guess.	1
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.	Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]	0
Is this one any good?	'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.	0
You're not dumb.	How do you know they're not?	0
We seem to say goodnight a lot.	If we went there, would you be able to find him?	0
And nobody else can do that?	Not the way I can.	1
Not that I know of.	Groceries maybe? A package?	1
Hold it down, Nick!	Where do we go from here?	0
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.	I'm not playing a game now.	1
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?	Sad? What made you sad?	0
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.	You're an interior decorator, right?	1
I don't have any sugar either.	I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.	0
You forgot this.	Thanks.	1
I'm not laughing, Steven.	You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!	1
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.	I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.	1
Okay, til tonight.	Tonight.	1
Sure.	Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?	1
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --	No --	0
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.	You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.	1
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?	Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.	1
The leaves...	Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.	1
I want to keep my teeth.	Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--	0
No.  I was going to let you do that.	He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.	1
May I finish?	Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?	1
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.	No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.	1
I have a brain.	Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.	0
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.	Wander about.	0
YES.	No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.	0
You remember what happened next?	I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --	1
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --	0
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --	-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.	0
You still have an aversion to the water?	The hell I am!	0
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-	Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.	0
And I thought I was weird.	You are weird. Let's just go.	1
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?	Nice?! He should have been executed!	0
Three hundred.	If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.	0
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.	Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!	0
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?	It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.	1
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?	Beautiful.	1
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.	That's worse.	1
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".	Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.	1
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --	Right.	0
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.	Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.	0
Norman!	No... we're together...	0
Prude.	Most people say the odds are against me.	0
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.	I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.	0
It looks done.	Think so?	1
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.	I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.	0
Oh my God...  You're blushing.	Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.	0
Yeah... No.	Look, if you want to leave...	1
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.	Good for you.  Good for you	0
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.	That's what I thought he said.	0
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?	Shit!  Apoc?	0
You've got to be kidding.	Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.	0
Hi. Hi, hi.	Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.	1
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?	Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.	1
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...	Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.	0
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?	Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.	0
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!	1
Now look what you did!	I saved your life is what I did!	1
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.	But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?	1
But why is he doing it?	Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!	0
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.	But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.	1
No scars?	No scars.	1
Well, time will tell, won't it?	The funeral's on Friday.	0
Right.	Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?	0
I wouldn't -	Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.	1
Oh shit.	Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?	0
Yes, sir.	City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...	1
What was <u>that</u>?	What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?	0
Go after her.	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.	1
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.	Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.	0
It's so nice.	There is something I must ask the Gods...	0
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.	Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .	1
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.	You mean it?	0
What happened?	Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.	0
Oh, you do?	Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.	1
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.	You don't have to do this.	1
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.	1
What are you going to do?	I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.	1
Your wife...	I'm not planning on it.	0
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.	You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.	1
He's Black, OK?	Rachel's job is she works.	0
No thanks.	Go on - you can have one!	1
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.	Not lately.	0
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.	0
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.	I haven't forgotten.	1
Where is it?	Upper West Side.	1
It means "happiness."	Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.	0
All right.	No--not much--excepting--	0
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.	My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.	1
I want to have a baby.	Forget how to ride a bike.	0
Well. What kinda job is it?	Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.	1
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.	It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.	0
I know.  He loves that thing.	I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.	0
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.	I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."	0
That's good. So then what do you do now?	Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.	0
It was...  ...one of them!	What was it like?	1
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.	Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Thereís a dirt track with a ëClosed to the publicí sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havenít heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?	1
Two million dollars?	Nothing lasts.	0
And you, are you in love with any one else?	Excellent.	0
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.	Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?	1
Give me your wrist.	Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...	0
Sure.	I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.	0
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.	It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?	0
Not exactly.	They were vampires, weren't they?	1
That's quite a secret.	I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --	1
You're the kid who was home schooled.	I don't trust that chatterbox.	0
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?	So I have to have a motive to be with you?	1
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?	On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.	1
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...	You know I want to...	1
It's so beautiful ... and sad.	I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.	0
What are you doing?	What, what?	0
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!	Yes.	0
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.	I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.	1
I tried again and got through.	What's wrong?	1
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.	Was it a boyfriend of yours?	1
Who do you think I was talking to?	A paper?	0
Right.	We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!	0
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.	The place is pretty dusty.	1
Let's leave here.	We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.	1
Put your arms around me.	Excuse me?	1
What's wrong?	Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --	1
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.	0
Yes...	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	1
I will be the judge of that.	It sounded like you did.	0
You heard about Julia Wolf?	Yes.	1
What are you talking about?	Do you expect me to believe that?	0
I just think you used to be bad.	No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?	1
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?	Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.	0
It relaxes me.	Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?	1
What things?	You don't know?	1
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.	Yes, I - yes, I do.	1
You lose!	I suppose anything's possible.	1
Okay, I guess.	Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?	1
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?	What?	0
Neither.	You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.	0
Is this what you call the "butler"?	Yes.	1
What?	The Red Sox	1
That means you won't have a gun.	What do you want ?	0
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?	God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.	0
Caesar, what are we going to do?	They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.	1
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.	As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.	0
What the hell's going on?!	Nice job.	0
With Robert Redford, when he was young.	Yeah...	1
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?	yeah, I had a bad night.	1
How do you mean?	We should stop seeing each other.	0
You mean he has the power of life and death?	No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.	1
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?	Do you wanna go to the van?	0
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.	think I left something back at the -	1
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.	Oh, my...	0
What are you talking about?	Do what?	0
Thank you.	Well don't thank me, because I want you to.	1
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.	That's why you come back, huh?	1
Why is that?	But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...	0
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?	Art. Well what do you want to know about it.	0
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.	You--don't know it, do you?	0
It was nobody's fault.	But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.	0
I got scared.	I can imagine.	1
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?	I do.	1
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?	Do you?	0
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.	Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?	0
Anyone else make it?	G-go on, I'm interested.	0
Yes, Mr. Gittes?	I don't want to drop it.	1
Thanks.	I was a lot earlier.	0
You look forward to this party all year.  Whatís with you today?	What's the matter?	0
Why don't you do it yourself?	He's lost complete faith in me--	1
You want to find them.	Yes.	1
What kind of trouble -- ?	And I don't think that was Tom.	0
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.	Did you know Noah Goldstein?	0
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.	Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.	0
Norman!	Get this thing off me.	1
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?	No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.	0
She's mistaken.	That's not good enough, Goddamit!	1
Will you kill me?	Sure.	1
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.	0
Oh God.	Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.	1
The best.	About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....	0
No.	Um, yeah -- thanks.	0
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?	Well I think you should.	0
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?	Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.	1
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.	0
Oh, no.	Aren't you? After today?	0
Do you think I told her to kill You?	No.	1
You look awful good in that uniform, though.	Sleep well.	0
You have ID?	Not really.	1
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.	The audition.	0
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.	I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...	1
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.	That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?	1
Okay...	I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...	1
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?	1
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.	I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.	0
I am impressed.	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.	1
No.  A witness.	I don't know which ball's mine.	0
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.	I can't do it, Jani.	1
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.	Elaine, we have to go back.	1
How come there's no punctuation?	Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.	0
Aren't you going to thank me?	Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.	0
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?	Who's got access to my goddamn file?	1
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?	Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-	1
You can't be too careful.	I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...	0
We'll be fine.	Did you invite them?	1
What?	Did you say, "I do"?	0
Philip!  The senior partner?	No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...	0
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.	You don't trust me.	1
What?	That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.	1
Yes, Addison.	Well... it's true.	0
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.	Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.	0
No. Why?	And six billion in the world.	0
For twelve francs, seventy-five.	Good.	0
Miles? You're scaring me.	We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.	0
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?	But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?	0
Are you coming to confess?	And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?	0
He served on the Goliath.	Wasn't that ship destroyed?	1
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.	1
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!	Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...	0
Well if I don't who will?	Okay.	0
Tell me about your wife...	Carla...	0
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.	0
But attractive--	<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--	1
That's what you said before.	I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.	0
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.	Hey, you know what I really think?	1
Of course.	I had to.  You made me.	0
Yeah.	As in daughter of Agamemnon?	1
So you're a lawyer.	That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?	1
You...you can't.	Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?	0
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.	Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.	0
I got scared.	You have some?	0
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.	Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --	1
Get away!	Turn!	1
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.	For real?	1
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?	Who's that?	0
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!	1
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...	There's more, isn't there?	0
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.	I don't think we're ready.	1
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?	0
More or less.	You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.	0
You never know when or where a story will break.	Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.	1
Which way ?	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.	0
My God you look exactly like him.	I never knew my father. Did you?	1
So what are you thinking?	No, come on. Anywhere you want.	0
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.	You what?	1
No!	Did Pop come down?	1
It was good.	I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.	0
You ever play one of these?	Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?	0
Yes, well...	Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.	0
Well, are you? Are you queer?	All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?	0
Who's Monsieur Philipe?	I don't trust anyone.	0
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.	Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.	1
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.	We...	0
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...	Good luck...	1
Maybe he's wet?	Maybe he's hungry.	1
That's swell!	I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.	1
And what did he come back now for?	Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.	0
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.	Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --	1
So now you hate all women?	I think it's my safest bet, don't you?	1
She will if you think she should.	Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.	0
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.	I can't write it!	0
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.	What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.	1
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?	Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?	1
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.	But you don't agree?	0
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.	I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.	1
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?	For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!	1
Is that how you play?	I try.	1
This isn't just a mood ring.	Does it work?	1
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?	Nothing, Rose.	1
How do you know?	I saw him today.	1
Oh, wow.	Um-hm. Live sound.	0
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!	1
You visiting?	Maybe.	0
She back in Kansas?	Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.	1
Where do you want to go?	She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...	0
Are you trying to be funny?	I'm totally serious!	1
Dodge.  Dodge.	What about it?	0
The prom -- you going?	That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?	0
I just...	You're there.	0
You went from high school to the Agency?	Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.	0
Well, we ate everything without you.	Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.	0
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.	Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.	1
Who is she?	No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.	0
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.	Is he in the bathroom?	1
As much as ever.  Nothing.	I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --	0
Your accident...	But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.	0
No ó- not yet.	And I never will- you know what's between us ó we're a thing But this is serious competition.	1
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.	0
Is he very much like you were?	Yes.	1
Leave now.	Okay, baby. Okay...	0
You were like a boy genius?	"I die knowing no one knew the real me."	0
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?	Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?	1
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.	Growing. I'm glad you said that.	1
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.	This kid just wants his freedom.	1
Dewey, you and I would never make it.	I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....	0
I love you.	What?	1
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.	It's okay. It's okay.	0
Why?	Why?  I don't know.	1
Andy, the theater's that way!	You need a vacation.	0
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.	That's nice.	0
I thought you lived in Chicago?	Detroit.	0
We're going to friends now, sir.	I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.	1
Peter Warne? I don't like it.	Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.	0
He's just a deep sleeper.	You mean you don't know where you were?	0
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.	Ya, that rack holds six ties.	1
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.	I don't know.	0
How do you know?	You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?	0
Two cars.  Where are you?	What?	0
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.	Okay.	0
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	Carrie.	0
Well, stay here tonight.	Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.	0
Could we hear God?	They'll lose because they're my team.	0
Three.	Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?	1
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?	God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?	1
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.	They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.	0
How do you think I'm doing?	And I didn't have an argument.	0
Why take the risk?	To see if I can get away with it.	1
A flare?  A flare won't do it.	No...	1
I thought you got through that pretty well.	"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.	0
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.	You know...	1
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.	Oh, yeah? How good?	0
You miss her, huh?	What-	0
What was she like?	Yup.	0
Why?	Keep it.	0
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!	Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.	1
So he really loved her?	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...	0
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.	That's lame, isn't it?	1
Are you--scared?	It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?	0
Little chilly.	Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!	1
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.	Me neither.	1
I know, Walter, but I --	What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?	0
How do you know all this?	No. Never again.	0
I want out of this marriage.	What?	1
Lotte? Is that you?	I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.	0
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.	A wolf.	0
What is he being charged with?	Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?	0
Anything I might know about?	You don't look half-bad.	0
What did he say?	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.	1
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.	Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?	0
I have no idea.	K through sixth.	0
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.	Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.	1
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.	Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.	1
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.	How did you ever remember me?	0
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?	What are you getting at?	1
Sailor?	No, I'm look --	0
Hello again.	Must one always be after something?	0
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.	May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!	1
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?	None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.	1
And you will come to hear us tonight?	If it's at all possible -	1
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --	Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.	1
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.	There never was, there'll never be another like you.	1
You're late, George.	What John Doe?	0
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.	Take it easy.	1
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?	What did he say?	0
Oh, no.	Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnít be violated.	1
Where is she then?	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.	1
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?	That what you do?	0
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.	Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --	1
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.	Okay...	1
Why?	'We?'	0
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.	You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?	0
Yeah.	All right.	0
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.	No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...	1
So who -- what -- are you?	Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...	1
--when you go away.	And you said yes?	0
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?	0
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.	He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...	1
How do you know about Dr. Becker?	My dad wrote some things down before he died.	1
What's that, written on the sail?	My epitaph.	1
Drove into Superior?  What for?	Thank you.	0
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.	Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?	0
I like the way he dresses.	What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?	1
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.	First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.	0
Dick...	I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.	1
Shut up.	Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.	1
That's me.	I'm Sheriff Deeds--	1
You think so?	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.	0
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.	Did it work?	0
It makes us human ...	It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.	1
You're joking.	No. Please. They're going to arrest you.	1
Jesus, Mulder...	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...	1
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.	Sorry.	0
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.	Orderly.	0
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?	I've heard of it happening.	0
We don't discuss it.	I can't take any more school.	0
So, whatís your point?	I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.	1
You could have asked for a favor.	No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?	1
And no AC.	Fan works.	1
All his life.  He's tried everything.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?	0
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...	Hear me out...	0
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.	Gotta go, Arletta.	1
What happened?	Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.	1
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.	Don't argue, goddamnit, just--	1
Half a million.	That Beynon's got a long arm.	1
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.	Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.	1
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"	I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...	0
What do I have to do to stop it?	I want you here.	1
I just asked a simple question.	I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.	0
I wasn't singing to myself.	Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.	1
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.	That's a nice teapot.	1
Okay.	No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.	1
Last I heard he went to San Diego.	If we went there, would you be able to find him?	1
You wanted to get the truth.	Yes.	0
And Hollis knew about it?	No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --	0
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.	Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.	1
Niece?	Please, call me Mordechai.	0
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.	I don't know any jokes about your name.	1
Yeah.	Huh. Kids?	1
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?	Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.	1
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?	I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?	0
You *couldn't*?	I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--	1
What is it you want?	Mine too.	0
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!	What did you say?	0
You and 'Honey'?	Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --	0
Do you want to go home, Ryan?	And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.	0
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.	What -- are you threatening me?	0
What else don't you believe in?	Talking while kissing.	1
Oh, please.	If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.	1
Yes.	What d'ya want to do to kill time?	1
I liked being with you last night.	See, I told you!	0
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.	1
Seeya tomorrow.	Okay, seeya.  Vada?	1
Clenched jaw...	I'm on at nine.	0
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?	0
So what's he doing? You believe him?	It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...	1
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.	I know what you mean.	1
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.	Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.	0
How much?	Yeah, sure. Of course.	0
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?	If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.	1
Did I say something wrong?	I'm sorry.	0
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?	0
It's coming along.	Thank you.	1
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.	No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.	1
Did you see him?	And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?	0
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.	Well, it seems to me...	1
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.	Well, anyway... Sorry.	1
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.	Yes.	1
Your kids never cry.	Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.	1
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'	And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?	1
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.	Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...	0
Is she all right?	I don't see any bruises or broken bones.	1
Yes, I did, John. But IóI had no idea what was going on.	You didn't?	1
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.	I can't till the hatch is flooded!	0
I'll do it --	Are you sure?	0
Thanks for helping.	Not at all.	1
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.	No, thanks.	0
Always?	Getting late.  We better get back.	1
No, sir. This is my own idea.	I see.	1
I know that, Dad, but --	More like other people putting their business in my nose.	0
Címon, Jack, you think there arenít mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Iím doing in New Jersey...	God, you... you're mean.	0
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.	You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?	1
Well, here I am.  See?	How are you doing?	1
Police?	I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...	0
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--	We definitely want it to have junk.	0
Not even a hunch. Just hope.	Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.	0
He did.	It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.	1
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.	Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.	1
Who?	Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.	1
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.	Justin?	1
Oh, I'm fine.	You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.	1
What about Larry --	Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?	0
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.	What do you mean?	1
No.	There's nothing sudden about tható  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.	1
Martin, it's not funny!	You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.	1
Dwayne -	Just make yourself comfortable.	0
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?	1
Jon, where are we?	Veidtπs complex.	1
No, no, no, not at all.	Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.	1
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.	I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...	1
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.	I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.	1
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.	Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.	0
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.	Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?	1
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?	It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?	1
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?	I've got a present for you...	0
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.	Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...	0
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.	Man, is this interesting.	1
Tell me more.	Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...	1
You got me.	I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...	0
Wow! It's brilliant!	Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.	0
Do it to ourselves?	We have to stick with the plan.	1
Michael...	Then the legs at the knees...	1
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?	Sorry?	0
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!	And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.	0
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.	Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?	1
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.	You guys got busted. This is a great neck.	1
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --	I'm not, I'm very happy.	0
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.	Have you got your passport?	1
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.	Never?	1
I asked you to keep your trap shut!	Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.	1
And what's this right girl like?	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.	0
You and the Colonel go back.	He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.	1
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-	Hah!	1
They asked.	And what was your answer?	1
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.	Ten years, I think. What I miss?	0
Let's talk about Conklin.	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?	1
Why didn't you turn on the light?	Just wait.	0
Better believe it.	Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.	1
How do you know?	I never forget a pussy... cat.	1
Want to be a high climber now, do you?	What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.	1
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Right back where we started.	0
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.	Are you, are you out of work or something?	0
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.	I'm your family.	1
With us.	On his day off. Get the exact address.	1
Walter!  Jeez!	Sorry...	1
You feel bad about this?  About me?	Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.	0
So you can use it now?	Yes... I suppose so.	1
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?	I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.	1
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.	El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...	1
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.	I'm very sorry.	1
You must be rich.	Now!	0
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.	What happened to Mandrake the Magician?	1
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.	Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.	0
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?	I'm through improvising.	1
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.	What are you doing in Mongi?	0
Don't you like me, Ben?	Don't be silly?	1
Not yet, dear brother...	Send them out!	1
But how can you be sure?	This is true love. You think this happens every day?	1
When?	It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.	0
I said I think it is.	Still clear?	0
I'm having a very good time, too.	So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.	1
Thank you very much.	Whoah, what a day, huh?	1
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.	I'm not going to be drawn into this.	1
Are you crazy? What are you doing?	Tonight.	0
We start from scratch--	But I don't know how --	0
Take care of her. She's a keeper.	Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.	0
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...	Yeah.	1
Very slick.	Do you like the colour?	1
Don't.	The...	0
A river pirate.	What?	0
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.	I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.	0
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.	What she call you?	1
Yes.	What is wrong with us?... We have everything.	0
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?	Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.	1
Did you say something?	No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?	1
Lemon.	Play something, Grace.	0
Who didn't?	That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.	1
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?	Not just a patient -- me.	1
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?	I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --	0
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.	So you never bought any land.	1
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --	Let's make a deal.	1
Sorry to wake you.	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -	0
What do you think you're doing?	Oh, hi.	0
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.	My darling.	1
It's ok to ask that.	I thought that you were anyway.	1
In the morning.	No.  Now.  You fucked him.	1
Yes... I'll give you that.	Thank you, Sera.	1
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..	1
You might have mentioned me first.	Well, I have a pretty good idea.	0
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?	Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.	1
He left us!  He left us!	That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!	1
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	Oh...	0
Quickly, close it.	No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.	1
Don't you ever stop?	I'm talking about... What are you talking about?	0
I never know when you're telling me the truth.	The pepper, too?	0
Did you --	No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.	1
But Ted, you're the only...	Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."	0
Will you bring up my purse before you go?	I have to go now. I'm sorry.	1
Alla puttanesca.	One more time.	1
Do you?	Uh-huh.	0
How is she?	Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?	0
Do you like pigeons?	--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.	0
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?	Look up, sunshine	0
He's got piano lessons.	Oh yeah? How's he doing?	1
Right around here, in the food court.	Sit down, leave the bag under the table?	1
What?	No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.	0
Care for some saki?	I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.	0
Of course I do!	Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.	0
Hi.	Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.	0
He gives a fuck what I do?	Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.	1
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...	... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.	1
Just don't tell Lydia.	Why not?	1
You gonna work at The Kingdom?	Depends on big brother.	1
Everything okay?	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?	1
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?	That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?	0
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.	Good night.	0
You must look at my face and not at the floor.	Anti social?	0
We made it!	Blockhead started it!	0
No, to be honest, I find it dull.	You don't have to do it for a living.	1
Ocean air!	Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.	0
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.	She won't? Why not?	1
I'm sorry --	You too.	0
I don't know... where is she, then?	Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?	0
He's directing now.	Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.	0
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!	Yeah, well they may this one.	0
For you. This is where you wanted to be.	But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.	1
You okay?	It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.	0
Do you know what to do?	I don't think he's breathing.	1
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.	You like?	0
You didn't care about my case?	I would now.	1
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.	Agreed.	0
Sing it to me, Frankie!	Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?	0
He looked old, didn't he?	I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?	1
Twelve years.	How did you get together?	1
You don't need to do that.	There's something I should tell you, Judy.	1
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.	You haven't finished your beer.	1
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.	See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.	1
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.	1
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.	You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.	1
Me?	Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.	1
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.	Tish-I'm-tee.	0
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...	I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.	1
Jack...can we afford all this?	Whatís the difference? Iím taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...	1
Why are you asking me all this?	I think it was a little more complicated than --	0
So now they believe me.	Yes, they believe you.	1
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?	I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?	0
He's better, though, right?	He's better.	1
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?	. . . What?	0
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.	I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?	1
You shot her?	Am I getting warm?	0
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?	Well... the red bra.	0
Are you proposing marriage to me?	Yes?	1
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.	You betrayed me!	1
From whom?	This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.	0
Don't tell me to calm down!	Why me?	0
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?	And you need your sleep.	0
Wolfi!	What? How can you be so boring? Tea!	1
I don't understand...	Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.	0
Good to see you're feeling better.	Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?	1
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...	Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!	1
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.	I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.	1
So what are you thinking?	I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...	1
He knows that?  Billy?	Yes.  He does.	1
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.	- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...	1
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.	I know.  Is *that* nothing.	1
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.	Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.	1
A jail?  Prison?	Underground.	1
Not really.	Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?	0
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.	It's Iggy Pop.	1
Almost a year.	Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.	0
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.	I don't have one.	1
Nice car.  Yours?	No.	1
I thought you weren't old fashioned.	Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.	0
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.	Hi, it's me...	0
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...	So what are you saying?	1
Please...	What's wrong with you?	1
I paid the money.	You want to try with me?	0
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?	I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.	1
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.	Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?	0
Weíre both thinking the same thing, right?	Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...	0
Janosz?	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?	1
You're not from beyond the valley.	When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.	0
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.	Drink your milk.	0
You haven't seen her yet?	No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...	1
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.	Sure.	0
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?	Because what I am interested in is right here...	1
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.	Jackie, can we --	0
The nerve.	Maybe. Maybe not.	0
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."	Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."	1
You don't believe in anything?	Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?	0
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...	I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.	0
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.	Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.	1
Just one favor.	Yes.	0
I more than liked it.	Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?	0
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...	Hello, Katmandu.	0
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.	Vivian, what the --	0
Daddy, it's true.	Emily -	0
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.	Maybe.	0
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax.	Come on...	0
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.	1
A few people.	Did anyone stand out?	1
Harmless - how?	Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.	1
Please!	What responsibilities?	0
I'm cold as ice.	I just talked to her.	0
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.	Yes, thank you.	0
In the South Wing.	Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!	0
Look at me.	Yes, ma'am?	0
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.	Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.	1
Have you ever tried American girls?	Why?	1
A flare up...	Forget it, Judy.	0
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.	Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.	0
Did Dickie's Dad go?	I'll call your brother.	0
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?	Mmm. An editor.	0
We, we have to give it.	Good morning, Swana.	0
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.	You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.	1
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.	Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?	1
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.	You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.	0
And mean it...	Can we order first?	1
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?	Yes?	0
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.	How'd you get to know so much about him?	0
He's trying.	Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.	0
What's their name?	Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.	1
What did you do?	I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.	1
Mulder -- it's me --	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.	0
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...	I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.	0
You followed me.	Orders.	1
What about now?	Mine, too.	0
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.	Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!	1
Where are we?	Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!	1
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?	My house.  I want to try something.	0
All right --	You don't have to, now.	0
What about them?	They could eat you.	1
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.	I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .	0
Syevodnya	Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.	1
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.	Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.	1
I didn't know you cared.	I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.	0
Finished with these?	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.	0
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.	Bloke told me.	0
I don't know.	Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.	0
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?	Nothing. I think I twisted my --	1
How can you ask me that?	You're making me feel guilty again.	1
I like--really need a cigarette, too.	You just smile, let me do all the talking.	0
I think, before.	Seems too coincidental that way.	1
Well, if that's the way you f...	Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?	1
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?	Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...	1
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.	I told you, he will.	1
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.	Want to take a walk?	1
And in return?	I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.	0
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--	1
Are they any agent?	Yes.	1
Oh. A nice one, I hope.	Many times.	0
Thank you.	A dollar seventy-five.	0
What?	He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.	1
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.	I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.	1
Well, stay here tonight.	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.	1
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.	Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.	1
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.	With Hypnocyl?	0
Chip, your ride is here.	Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.	1
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?	There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?	0
Charisma?	Aw, he isn't that good...!	0
I assume this is on Rex?	Isn't everything?	1
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--	--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?	1
You're lost?	Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?	1
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?	Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.	1
No --	One more. Smile. One more.	1
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.	I don't know what you're talking about.	1
You're shaking. What is it?	It's gone now.	0
Breakfast?	Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?	1
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.	You wouldn't be a widow long.	1
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?	I need to go now.	1
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.	You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.	0
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!	Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?	0
We needed to know all we could.	I'm going to look around.	1
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?	I don't know.	1
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.	I want my pills NOW!	0
I knew I could rely on you.	Thanks.	1
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!	A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.	1
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.	You've had plenty of time already!	1
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...	Where was this?	0
Hurray!	I do?	0
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!	Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?	0
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.	No... Sharp -- You look great.	0
What?  Like amnesia?	Look, go ahead...put the radio on...	1
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.	It's a great song.	1
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.	That was stressful. I found that stressful.	1
I don't know. One of your friends.	A woman.	1
You smell like baby powder.	We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.	0
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?	Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.	1
Dwayne -	You'd do this to me!	1
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?	Ouch!	0
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?	I don't write.	0
So?	Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.	1
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?	We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.	0
Like you?	Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!	1
-- go ahead.	-- well aren't you --	1
I don't like my real name.	What's your real name?	1
He ask, I give him anything.	Look who's talking.	0
I'm sorry. That was nasty.	Life is confusing, isn't it?	1
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.	What did you find?	1
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?	Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.	0
Cypher?  Where's Tank?	He had an accident.	1
Disappointed.	She never told Eddie, though.	1
What about you?	Don't worry about me, just go.	1
They were jealous of him.	Why?  Because he had you?	1
Who was that?	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.	0
And you ask questions, right?	Yes.	1
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.	Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.	1
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?	Taking care of business.	1
Not since you broke into society.	Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.	1
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.	What would you do differently?	1
Yeah?	I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!	0
You're here.	No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.	0
It was bad, wasn't it.	Flares?	0
How was lunch?	Huh?	1
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?	I didn't, baby, you just told me.	1
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?	You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?	0
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.	I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.	1
Why would they care what we think?	Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.	0
Oh my God.	Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...	1
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?	No! I love sex with girls.	0
'Course it does.	First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.	1
I think that's for the best.	Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.	0
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?	No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.	1
What a day - what a heavenly day...	D-day.	1
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.	Who?	0
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?	What's that?	1
It is. It's lovely.	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?	0
I'm glad you came.	Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.	1
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!	To you, to me it's Thursday.	0
That's classic.	Why... ?	1
What's this... have you been smoking... ?	The human condition.	0
I'm sure.	Now you know.	0
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.	Well, when you put it that way.	0
You don't look very happy to see me.	Should I be ?	1
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons ñ-	Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.	1
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--	Do what--	1
I asked you to keep your trap shut!	Ok.	0
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.	I'd like to say it a thousand times.	0
What didn't you like about her?	What did you tell him?	0
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.	Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.	0
You dog!	Goodbye, darling.	1
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.	Do you think your father means that?	0
I don't know. I just feel it.	And you're sure about that?	1
What are you sorry for?	I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.	1
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?	Yeah. Excuse me a sec.	1
We were in a car accident --	They were in a car accident.	1
I should hope not.  I hate you!	That sudden?	1
Dylan, where's the man?	Really.	0
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.	But she mentioned Beaumont by name?	0
All it takes is one second?	Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.	1
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.	Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?	0
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.	With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.	1
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...	It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.	1
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.	What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!	1
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.	"I found a million dollar babyó"	1
There's little chicks!  You want to see?	What are you talking about?	0
Boris Karloff!?	Close!  The <u>other</u> one!	1
Disease? What disease?	Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.	1
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --	0
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?	I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.	0
No.	It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.	0
I got an awful toothache.	Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.	1
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?	Doesn't matter. Move on.	0
I know.	At a gas station.  Will you marry me?	1
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.	Cynthia...what's going on?	1
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.	Itís cute.	0
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.	Both.	0
Don't touch me. Or so help me --	Just go.  We can manage without you.	0
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.	Say, could I meet him?	1
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.	I'm sorry.  Do you live here?	1
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.	Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.	1
Travis?	Yeah.	1
Sparkling rocks?	Little ones.	1
I see...	Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.	1
I don't need a shrink.	Harvey says he's amazing.	1
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.	Not if I stay away from him.	1
They're not happy, sir.	I'm not happy.	1
Tank, you're hurt.	The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...	0
You're afraid of germs?	I have to go.	1
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.	I did, yeah.	0
He's a very sweet man.	Was he unfaithful?	0
Will you?	It's a big and busy funeral home.	0
That's great!	How can I possibly thank you?	1
Will I like it?	You'll like it fine.	1
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?	Something like that.	1
How's work?	That's the one.	0
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!	Willie!	1
I asked you a question. Do you love her?	Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.	1
Getting to what?	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --	1
How are you going to pay when you get sick?	I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.	1
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.	0
What?	Want another cigarette?	0
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?	Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.	0
What are you doing?	Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.	0
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...	What fake blind date? What are you talking about?	1
You're cute, Max.	Okay.	0
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?	I think he did it to himself.	0
I don't... why... why do you do this?	I'm sorry this came up.	1
Go ahead.	Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.	0
Is there an ashtray in here?	No.	1
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.	You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.	1
Yes -- oh!	I can sit through it once.	0
Tell me about it.	If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?	0
I saw an article...	I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.	1
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?	He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?	0
I work for city hall.	Good.	0
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!	No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...	0
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.	That's right.	0
You got some?	I know where to get some.  Don't move.	1
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...	In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.	0
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Heís not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subís reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.	Made to look just like an accident.	1
How?	Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...	1
Uh huh.	Yeah, where is the spider?	0
Hey!  That's my boss!	Better yet.	1
There's a list.	It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -	0
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!	0
Ahh, look, right now's not very...	I donít think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Weíll put Annie and Josh in private schools...	0
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?	Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.	1
Yes, you!	I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.	0
Uh-uh-why?	I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.	1
Which one?	Nothing.	0
Is that true?	Little known fact.	1
You pushed me...	I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.	1
No.	You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.	0
Who was your girl before Annette?	I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.	0
Do I look okay?	You and me.	0
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.	Goodnight, my dear.	0
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.	And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?	1
I couldn't help it óó I loved him.	No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.	0
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.	I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.	0
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--	Try to communicate with her somehow.	0
Wbat're you talking about?	What's the matter with you?	0
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.	But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.	0
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?	Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.	1
What are you taking?	I keep the heat on.	0
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.	What?	0
What are we playing for?	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.	0
Yes sir	Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.	0
Expect so.	Did my brother Frank find out?	1
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?	Commercials.	0
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?	Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.	1
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.	You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...	1
Don't rub it in.  I live here.	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?	1
C'mon...	Nah, I don't do that anymore...	1
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.	Yeah. Come on.	0
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.	Because you're getting on that plane.	0
Come on, bargain with me.	I could let them go for ten.	1
Not really.	Is there something we can do?	1
You're sure?	Is he in the bathroom?	0
That infernal phone!	How come?	0
2:00 A.M.	You doin' anything tonight?	1
Trix...	Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!	1
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?	I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.	1
That's right.	Nothing.	0
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.	All right, then. It's your secret.	0
Get out of the way.	No.	0
You're not at the center.	Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.	0
KipÖ I -	You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.	0
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.	I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!	1
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!	The "man" again.	0
They already know it's you.	You believe me, don't you?	0
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.	I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.	1
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.	Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...	1
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.	Oh, that's nice.	1
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.	Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?	1
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.	Hey, that was last year.	1
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.	I don't know.  I'm sorry...	0
So I don't like tents, why--	You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--	1
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.	Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.	1
Yeah.	Me too.	1
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...	Are you torturing me on purpose?	0
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?	Four months.	1
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.	Well, Ben... I...	1
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.	I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --	0
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?	That's because most of it never happened.	0
Paillarde of veal.	It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.	0
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.	I think I should.  3000W?	1
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?	Don't think that'd be wise.	1
When did you decide?	It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.	1
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.	You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.	1
Where's Michael?	He's already gone to bed.	1
Um, because you didn't want to go.	Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.	1
You volunteered?	It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.	1
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?	So do day jobs.	0
Shit. You better tell me something.	Good. Or should I speak slower?	0
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!	You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?	0
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.	What's with the dark?	1
What'd you say, Brother?	She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.	1
Oh, Nick... Nick!	Yah.	0
...but you're not -- you're not sure...	Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.	0
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.	It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.	0
Give it to meó my Pop's jobó	What makes him so special?	1
Feel that?	Is Dunbar cute?	0
The final countdown.	Oh.  I brought you something.	1
How about if I try humility.	How about if you try disappearing.	1
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?	Does he love you?	1
Me, too. And very erotic...	Tell me about yourself.	1
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.	You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.	1
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?	What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.	1
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.	Very good, Mrs. Peel ...	1
Then you'll die.	I want every second I can get with you.	1
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.	-- OK?	0
I thought we were helping.	I can hire workers to help me.	1
Yes.	Now?	1
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.	0
Two hundred pounds.	Now, pet--  Jim!	0
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?	I call that regular.	0
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -	Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?	1
A box?	They don't know.	0
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.	That so.	0
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?	Margo, let's make peace.	0
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?	I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.	1
Stu?	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.	1
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.	Okay, okay--I know you do, too.	1
What does he look like?	You might be disappointed.	1
I want to ride my own bike.	My Dad always drives my Mom.	1
What are you doing... ?	Get out.	1
He likes you well enough to stick around.	Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.	1
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?	But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.	0
I don't want it now.	Thought you were hungry!	1
Did you bring your grey suit?	Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?	1
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?	Let's waste him.  No offense.	0
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?	Yes.	1
What are you talking about?	Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...	0
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.	I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.	1
Just back up.	I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?	1
What?	Have you been there recently?	0
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?	Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.	1
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.	I wish I did.	0
No, really.	Really.	1
I am not a wealthy woman.	But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?	1
A grave...	SorryóI didn't mean toó	0
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...	Why not tell me now?	0
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...	...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?	1
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.	I keep the heat on.	0
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!	1
You're a little touchy about it.	I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?	1
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!	You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!	0
Oh yeah?	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?	1
And I really don't know your noises yet.	Well, when you wonder, ask me.	1
Where are you taking us now?	Put your shoulders back, I said.	0
I thought I...you..	You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.	1
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!	Let's get you out.	1
Manifested?	Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --	1
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!	It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?	1
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	What's that?	1
Did you see that?	What?	1
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?	1
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -	Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -	1
No. I'm OK. Thanks.	You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.	0
Patrick?	Looks like you know a song.	0
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.	You see? Life can be so simple.	1
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.	Just follow me.	0
Do? To who?	Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.	1
What makes you think it's you?	It's not me?	1
I'm not the pig you are.	Who?	1
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.	That must have been pretty special.	1
I did what you told me to.	Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.	0
It's two weeks.	Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.	0
Won't take any time.	...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --	0
I'm going back home.	And a *lot* of paper!	0
To quarter-horses.	I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...	0
Morning, darling.	They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.	0
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...	Yes?	0
What's that?	No, I don't.	0
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.	Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?	0
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?	TELL ME, DAMN YOU!	1
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.	Right.  Yeah.  I had a...	0
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.	I think.	0
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?	Only around humans.	1
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.	You're lying --	0
Goodbye.	Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?	0
Yes.	I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.	1
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.	What? What are you saying?	1
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--	Have you been hurt?	1
Friends?	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.	1
Yes, yes, I did.	It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.	0
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.	I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.	0
<u>Do</u> it...	And you?	1
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.	This is Stargher we're talking about?	1
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?	Pull over.	0
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Can I ask <u>you</u> something?	0
No. You know too many sick ladies.	They're Biblical. They were prophets.	0
I'm going to try to do better.	What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.	0
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.	Hello?   No, operator...	0
I want out of this marriage.	Why?	1
I think she's gonna kiss him.	I just wanted to make sure.	0
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?	I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.	1
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.	No, I'm lost.	1
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.	It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.	1
What're you doin', baby?	Goin' out.	1
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.	Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?	1
Well... goodnight.	Yeah.  Goodnight.	1
Wow, this is so cool...	Fuck you.	0
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.	No you didn't.	1
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.	I donít know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.	0
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?	Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?	0
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.	Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.	0
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?	This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.	1
So where are you from?	What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --	0
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.	Maybe an animal.	1
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.	We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.	1
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.	What was it then?	1
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.	Good thing.	1
About me!	Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.	1
No!  I mean... why so soon?	I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.	0
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.	Actually, I am, though.	0
You're lying. I don't believe you.	But you don't?	0
I think you're so right, Kevin.	You want to do it?	1
No problem.	Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.	1
Is she gonna die?	No.	1
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?	I confess.	0
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	Got a nice evening dress?	1
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...	And you?	0
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?	Right.	1
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Geller, this is way out of your league.	0
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?	I didn't say that.	1
Yes.	I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.	1
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!	Em iram! Em iram!	1
Cloven hoof?	Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.	1
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?	What?	0
I came to say goodbye.	Gosh! What do you know about that!	0
Yes...	Maxine.	0
She called you, didn't she?	Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.	0
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.	How could I not?	1
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.	What?	0
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?	I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.	0
Jerome--?	Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.	0
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.	Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.	1
I'm going to call the police.	That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.	0
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...	Yeah, geography.	1
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.	And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?	0
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.	His own doctor?	1
No. And before you ask, no, heís not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...	Any friends?	1
Please don't make me say it again.	Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.	0
Would you like me better if I were a nun?	It's either that or we grow gills.	0
Are you the boy for me ?	Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...	0
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.	What the hell are you talking about?	1
Are you serious?	Yeah ... I'm out.	1
So who are you?	You fuck for money.	0
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.	Okay, knock it off.	1
'Course it does.	Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.	0
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.	Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?	1
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.	What was inside?	0
So.	No.  But I wanted to.	0
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -	Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?	1
What a beautiful fish.	We don't want to be any trouble.	0
Crafts.	Crafts?	1
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!	Oh no I didn't!	1
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?	I've no choice	1
Cole, I'm sorry, I...	Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.	0
Sure you don't want to come with me?	Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.	0
Dance with me?	Well, I do.	0
What are your favorite buildings, David?	What could I be up to, Lula?	0
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?	You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.	0
And you think it's in there?	Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.	1
Sometimes. Afterward.	You're not far from Cypher.	0
God, Dana's going to kill you!	...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?	1
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...	Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.	0
Sorry, old man. Work.	I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.	0
Feels good.	Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?	1
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--	Don't you <u>realize</u>--	1
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.	Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.	0
Hello, Leon darling!	Hello.	1
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...	But, I...	1
Refresh my memory.	How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?	1
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.	And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?	1
Would you like something? Some coffee?	Is anyone having this...?	1
...Aren't you skating?	Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.	1
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...	I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.	0
I thought we were helping.	No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...	0
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --	Sweet.	1
What about the Mayor?	Tom Jones?	0
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...	I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.	1
Yes.	No. No. It's too good a story.	0
You don't understand.	Chaos.	0
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.	Where is the Fortress?	0
You could leave, Paul.	What are you saying, Tatsi?	1
Likewise.	Yup.	0
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.	Did you see who posted it?	0
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?	Yeah, well --	0
How long then?	Long enough for us to do the nasty.	1
So what's your novel about?	Really? That was fast.	0
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?	I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?	1
Vaguely...	Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?	0
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...	Try not to sweat?	1
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...	Come on, gal...	1
I guess we've been staying up too late.	I know it.	1
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --	No.	0
Know what?	Care to make a wager on that?	0
But I'm not. The newspapers're --	Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.	1
What?	We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.	1
I see.	You always been this stubborn?	0
I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that...	1
Is she coming back?	No.	1
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.	Rams... that's football, right?	1
He's my favorite.	Two, please.	0
Is that anything?	Thanks just the same.	1
Why?	Because she'll scare them away.	1
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	No, Eve. I like you to be here.	0
Why?	I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.	1
Listen, you are witnessing genius!	I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.	1
Hi.  What are you doing?	Nothing.	1
That was quite a thing you did today.	I can't do it, Jani.	0
So, do you think you made it into the class?	Looking for Maggie.	0
Mm hmm.	Where are you at least?	0
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?	Let's go talk to Bill...	0
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.	I don't know.	0
Donnie?	I pray God grants it me.	0
Unbelievable.	Seven it is.	1
Why?	I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.	1
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	1
Does everything have to have a point?	Things change!	0
Remember -- open mind.	But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?	0
Take a deep breath and hold it.	That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.	1
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.	1
No no no no no no no no no...	They're in the basement.	0
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.	How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?	1
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...	What does that mean?  What does he do?	0
Nothing.	He could give me some oxygen.	0
Well he's not exactly a friend.	What're you -- what?	0
You?! How about me?	Okay.  Cottage Number Three.	0
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?	Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.	1
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.	All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?	1
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.	Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.	0
I can't find my ball.	Can you see it?	1
Okay.	...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.	0
What's that?	Let me kiss you.	1
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.	Now you know.	1
Great, bye.	Yeah.	0
Anderton --	No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?	0
Now just a minute...	Ta-ra.	1
With Stargher I saw things...	What did you see?	1
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.	So, where's "Weird Al"?	1
Dick...	What do I need for that?	0
HELP! HELP!!	No... we're together...	0
Yes, but Ió	That's all, Miss Bennett.	1
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.	I know, you want go for a ride.	1
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.	It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?	0
How do you spell it?	P-a-r-a-s-o...	1
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.	Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...	1
You're really leaving, huh?	Highly suspect.	0
Where are they?	The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them	1
You're here.	What about the guy he put in the body cast?	1
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?	You might still have a house.	0
-- who's married to --	Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --	1
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...	She was killed, Penny.	1
How have you dumped girls in the past?	Screening calls. Any suggestions?	1
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?	I'll loan you a raincoat.	0
...Why?	Remember Lyle Barton?	1
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.	Maybe he's hungry.	0
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...	You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?	1
To death?	Yeah.	0
Where?	Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?	0
What are you?	Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.	0
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...	Unless what?	1
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --	You mean leave the magazine?	0
Always?	Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?	0
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -	You was friends.	0
Hi.	I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.	0
He's pretty laid back, confident.	I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.	0
What's his name?	Don't know.	1
Sporting events, yeah.	All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?	1
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.	I could take after Dad, too.	0
A gift.	For what?	1
Let me pass!	You must listen to me before you go.	1
Three minutes, thirty seconds.	Did you hear what I said?!!	0
Don't go near the bowling alley.	Ok. What's your name?	0
No thank you. We should be off.	Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...	0
We're partners.	I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.	1
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.	Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?	1
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.	Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.	1
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?	Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.	0
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.	You wave back?	1
No! I look ridiculous!	What did they want to know?	0
I'm never going back.	Is that Nietzsche?	0
Good afternoon--	Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.	0
No.  What's my cut?	You get an equal cut.	1
Are you having an affair?	Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.	0
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.	That doesn't make any sense.	0
Cut it out, Sam.	Will you please turn back.	1
Think about it. Okay?	Sure.	1
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.	Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --	0
Does he know you know?	He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.	1
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.	No, why?	0
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?	Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.	0
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?	Won't you join us?	0
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.	She got anything good?	0
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.	We might as well pack.	0
Or what you see in me, for that matter...	No speech.	0
Really?	Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?	1
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.	No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.	1
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.	-- just --	0
Mm-hm.	And I fig- and I figured something out.	1
I've been thinking.	Guess "please" would be a stretch.	0
xxxxxx	xxxxxx	1
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!	No honey.	1
You real down?	He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.	0
Never.	Jesus!	0
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?	You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?	1
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.	Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.	1
I want to go home.	I was just kidding.	1
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.	All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.	1
Twelve months in oak.	On a Sauvignon Blanc?	1
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...	And you believe her?	1
No. Are you tired?	No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?	1
This isn't working out.	It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.	0
Just trying to get my apartment in order.	Can I lend you a hand?	1
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?	Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.	0
That you were fired.	A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!	0
At least you and Kendall agree on that.	Why don't you open it and find out?	0
I want to give you something. Will you let me?	Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.	0
I came with Captain Renault.	Sure, Gino, sure.	0
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?	Yes.	0
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.	Big deal.	1
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.	Where have they gone?	0
I think you better leave.	I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.	0
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.	What do you tell Nicolet?	1
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.	But you didn't hurt --	1
By the way, how's he doing?	He's dead.	1
And that's why you're losing your bet?	Don't answer me. Say what I say.	0
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...	Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?	0
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?	No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.	1
Where am I?	The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...	1
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?	No. It's a lot further than that.	0
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.	Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.	0
You're not?	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.	0
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.	Things a man isn't supposed to know.	1
And now?	And now I want you.	1
Tell me what it was.	A car.	1
Why can't you come...	No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...	1
Mr. Van Orton... ?	I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?	0
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?	1
Oh. That. Rome.	Hm...	0
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!	Nothing.	1
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.	You're giving me the creeps.	0
What's happened?	Who?	0
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?	Nobody ever said it.	1
I want out of this marriage.	Oh.  No.	0
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.	What's he talking about?	0
It was a place to start.	...Were you?	0
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?	You're right. Only you can do that.	0
Just be careful, okay?	I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?	1
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.	Darling, you're wonderful.	1
How do you do.	Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?	0
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?	I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.	1
That's really strange. What does it mean?	One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.	1
Good.	But why shouldn't I?	1
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--	Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --	0
What is it? What's wrong?	Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?	0
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.	Oh. Gary's loudmouth.	1
What's this?	Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.	0
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.	Harry.	1
Damn straight.	Damn straight!  We were heroes.	1
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.	As always.	0
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.	Yes, I reckon that's it.	0
But the setup's there. It's there now.	I don't think I need it.	1
I'll be ready.	Yeah.	1
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?	She's too powerful, Raziel	0
You're an animal.	That's true. What are you?	1
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.	There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.	1
Yes?	The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.	0
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.	So she seems.	0
You think I should do Henry James instead?	I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.	1
Do you ever regret not having a family?	Not everybody's supposed to have a family.	1
What are you talking about?  It's over.	Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.	1
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?	Well, why not?	1
We need to talk --	Seven.	1
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...	Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.	0
Do I not please you, Jack?	She'll need both of us.	0
What papers?	The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.	1
Just feeling a bit sick.	Not quite.	0
You're a good man, Hardy.	Really.	1
I know. He's just the best.	I've got Jews at my table.	1
They'll come out after us.	I agree.	0
We have room!  Let's go!	What do you mean?  What happened!	1
Then..then what's that music?	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.	0
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?	I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.	0
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.	Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.	1
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.	I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.	0
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.	I just told the Father.	0
I don't know.  I have to think...	That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.	0
Why all the way to Del Rio?	Did you talk to Corey?	0
A franc for your thoughts.	I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.	0
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.	1
Go away! You've spoilt it.	What's your plan of attack?	0
If I tell you, will you arrest me?	Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!	0
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?	'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.	0
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.	Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?	0
What... huh?	If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.	0
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.	What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?	0
But how?	I know where to look.	0
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.	The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.	0
Did you hear the child out?	Well, it seemed to me --	1
Not much further.	You never went, uh, all the way?	1
You must be exhausted.	Start killing people for real?	0
K.	This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?	0
I never expected to see you again.	Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.	0
Sounds risky to me.	I couldn't help.	0
What does she think she's gettin?	Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.	0
Can't we change course?	That's it? That's what you're giving me?	0
Well--me, too!	But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?	1
Reverend Edwards.	Mmmmm, this is tasty.	0
How was the game, honey?	Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, whereís that chocolate cake...?	1
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.	I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.	0
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.	Tonight?	0
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?	Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.	0
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.	A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.	0
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.	Or we could do that yeah.	0
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.	We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.	0
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.	What?	0
I know that. I do what I want.	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.	0
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?	You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.	1
Go Carole.  So, guess what?	I don't know...	1
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.	He left!	1
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.	Goodnight, Mary.	0
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.	And?	1
Would you like to come in?	I knew you would.	0
Okay, how do you want to do it?	Your father?	0
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.	Wendy...	0
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.	You don't do that anymore, do you?	1
Sorry.	Looks like you know a song.	1
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.	I'm alright. Please.	1
The plutonium is missing.  Theyíve taken the core!	Out - I may be some time	0
Hello, Rex.	Yes.  My best friend.	0
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?	Oh, how is he?	0
What kind of movies do they show there?	Gay movies.	1
And you are?	Looking for Maggie.	1
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --	In an underground club? I'd like to see that.	0
Ready?	Yeah.  One, two, three...	1
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?	We're not all frigid.	1
Do you think I took some of that money?	I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.	1
Are you in love with someone else?	Maybe I can help?	0
This is so unfair.	That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.	1
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.	Good.	1
I've been thinking.	Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?	1
I'd take him to the doctor.	Come on.  We don't have much time.	0
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.	So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.	0
Because I'd be to blame, right?	What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.	0
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...	Could have...	1
The General threatened me.	Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.	0
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.	Me neither.	1
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?	Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!	0
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.	What?	0
Oh, I'm sure it will!	Then forget it.	1
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!	You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...	1
I guess.	And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?	1
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.	As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?	0
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.	Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?	1
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."	Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.	1
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?	Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.	1
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?	Why don't you try him again?	0
Three fifteen.	A.M -- or P.M.?	1
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.	I didn't want to wake you.	0
So who... Whoís the man? Where is he?	Some Italian I picked up back there. Heís in the boot of the Mustang.	1
Get out.	That's it!	0
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?	Yes, dear.	0
How about a lift home?	Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.	1
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.	Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...	1
What?	He said he knew Karate!	0
You don't have to.	I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.	1
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?	Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.	1
You're a fuckin' mess.	Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.	0
Tell that man not to drive so fast.	The Sistine Chapel?	0
Ha. Did he say why?	Would four of them -- ?	0
Benjamin?	You won't want to watch. Turn around.	0
What's that?	That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.	1
John! Don't!	Better than catching Sean's herpes.	0
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!	Try me.	0
A hotel?	It's a loft.	1
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?	Jeffrey.	1
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-	All you got to do is name it.	1
Because if you do, I'll kill you!	Okay... I promise.	1
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.	If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.	1
And the other alternative?	What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.	0
I got it on sale.  A real steel.	Here.	1
Let me know.	Okay, don't stop.	1
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.	If I see him.	1
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.	Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--	0
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.	I'm a professional killer.	0
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.	Frank told me.	0
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.	-- fuck you.	0
You promised justice.	Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.	0
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.	Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?	1
Is this a bad time.	Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.	0
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.	I think so, Beth.  Yes.	0
Here comes a car!	Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.	1
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.	out again?	0
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...	Come here.	1
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.	Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?	0
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.	And why do you tell us this only now?	1
Yes..	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.	0
No!  Don't go.	My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.	0
You don't understand! It's her father...	Mr. Rose *knows*?	1
Honey --!	You know what I'm saying, Joe?	1
If he files are you going to take the case?	I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.	1
How close are you?	I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--	0
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?	Almost two a.m.	0
You were wonderful!	Sez you!	0
Pretty.  She's a blond.	Do you have any idea who she is?	1
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--	Oh yeah?	0
I bet you're a damn good poker player.	C'mere, I'll show you.	0
Well what?	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?	0
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.	So you're monumentally busy?	0
He came to kill us.	-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --	1
Everybody's rich.	No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.	0
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.	What the hell are you talking about?	1
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?	Yes.	0
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?	Hi, lady.	1
Where?	We're gonna get married.	1
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.	Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.	0
Do you like my body?	I think she liked me.	0
What's your problem?	Nothing.	1
Is there something I can do to help you?	We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?	0
Certainly, Mr. Duke!	My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?	1
That's where it gets a little strange.	And what about the guy that was following me?	1
Can't.	Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.	1
You said something to him, didn't you?	No. Youíll be safe here.	0
How'd it go?	Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.	0
-- Can't seem to escape you today.	All right...	0
No!	It's not suffering anymore.	1
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.	I only dream about people who are dead.	0
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.	Nothin'.	0
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.	New York.	0
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --	Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.	1
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.	Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.	0
Nice spot.	Yeah, but in a nice way.	0
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.	1
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.	- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.	0
You're going to take me back?	Or perchance...	0
You are a therapist, right?	No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.	1
Why?	Just let me know when you are going out and where --	1
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.	Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?	1
Oh, this is Betty.	Sounds intriguing.	0
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!	It takes me comfortable.	1
You looking for some action?	I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.	0
Then it's God, right?	It's something.	1
Hey ! What are you doing here ?	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.	1
No. Don't do this.	But your men are watching over Yu's compund?	0
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.	What about her?	0
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.	Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?	1
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...	The Steering Committee.	0
Is that like a party trick?	All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'	1
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.	Had some bad relationships, didn't you.	1
Where's the body?	The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.	1
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.	A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.	1
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?	I was flying...my responsibility.	0
Yes. Do you want...	I have no life.	1
No, you don't.	Yes, I do. I love them!	1
What happened to Len Tashka?	Couldnít make it. Splitting headache.	1
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.	You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?	0
It's tainted money, Doctor.	What a beautiful thought, Marquise.	1
Can I tell you something?	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.	0
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?	We'll find out.	0
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.	Where's the girl?	1
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --	I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.	1
I never get my hair done.	No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?	0
Coffee and a donut.	I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.	1
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.	This is the place.	1
Please. Why not?	Because it was a lie.	1
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?	No, just the paper will be fine.	1
Do you like kids?	Lighten up...	0
Looks familiar?	No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...	1
Sounds pretty well figured out.	Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!	0
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.	If the key's on him, how do we get the key?	0
It's all right.	It's home.	0
Yes.  But do you know?	Oh -- sure. Thank you.	0
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?	Sure.	1
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?	The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!	0
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."	So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.	1
Honey, what is it?	I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.	0
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.	Not now, Elaine!	0
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.	You sound like you mean it.	0
You splendid bastard...	Uh...	0
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.	I'm going home.	1
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?	I'll join you shortly.	0
Are they going to work here too?	I do. I'm -- are you...?	0
Who's there?	Let me in.	1
Where's Ronnie?	Well I don't...	1
What are you doing?	I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.	1
Then why are you here, Joe?	I came to see you.	1
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.	Well I can't.	0
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.	Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?	0
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.	I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.	0
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?	I notice you still remember it.	0
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?	They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.	1
I think Daddy suspects.	No, he doesn't. Not really.	1
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.	0
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.	They make gypsies look good.	1
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.	0
I'm all wet.	Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...	0
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!	What did he want?	0
You tell me.	But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.	0
Yes, but...	...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...	1
I'm not interested at all.	Well, I'm not.	1
Just a few minutes ago.	And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.	0
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?	No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.	0
Really?	Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.	1
Look!	Good...	0
I know. Put Scott through college.	I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.	1
I went to the movies.	What'd you see?	1
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.	We don't know that --	1
I haven't had fun like that since college.	Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.	0
Where are you going?	She's there? What's she doing there?	0
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.	Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.	0
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?	Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.	1
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?	Meda.  Meda.	0
Yeah? You sure?	Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-	0
Yeah?	Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.	0
And gives it to you.	... Mean through the tubes?	0
It's all important --	Not really.	1
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.	But I have my clothes on!	0
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --	That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.	0
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.	Talk about what?	0
Not at all.	But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.	1
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.	Talk about what?	1
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?	I'm coming.	0
You mean --	Because... it's better for me that way. OK?	0
Did you say something?	Oil can....	1
You are an animal.	Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.	1
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.	Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?	1
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.	I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --	0
You didn't marry Donna Reed.	Absolutely.	0
How do you do, Mr. Worley?	Stand back.	0
I can't.	It's not mine either.	0
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.	Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.	0
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.	She's just not the girl for me.	1
Up the coast.	How far?	1
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.	What do you want from me, Catherine?	0
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.	You won't keep growing at this rate.	0
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...	And your father? Is he from New York?	0
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.	Yeah, well, she started all that in London.	1
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?	She will succeed.	0
In the car.	Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.	1
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.	I can't work this.	0
But you don't mind.	No, I don't mind.	1
My own father...	It looks nice.	0
Come on!!	Could ya take off that hat.	0
You really think it would make a difference either way?	You must.	0
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.	0
Why?	Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.	1
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---	We've got some things to discuss.	1
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?	And why haven't they left each other?	1
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?	She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.	0
Vulcan?	No.	1
This stuff is so sticky.	You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.	0
You're gonna use a ram?	Could you be more desperate to read it?	0
I'm looking for...	He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.	1
That was another time.	How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.	1
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.	Yeah, that's pretty much it.	1
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.	That's not crazy. I like you too.	1
Bastard, sneak, quitter.	Speaking.	1
That's called changing your mind.	No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.	1
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --	Jackie, she was five minutes late --	1
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -	0
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.	Yes.	1
I should go to the house, get breakfast.	I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?	0
Put your head back.	Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?	1
He was your friend.	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.	1
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.	And you know, he really does not.	1
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.	The one in the mine!	0
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.	Boyfriend?	0
Goodnight, Benjamin.	You believe me, don't you?	1
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?	Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.	1
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?	Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.	0
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.	Like hell "wait."	0
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!	Who's Dr. Tom?	1
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?	Why, what's gonna happen?	0
You can't just... kill him.	I'm not.  Just a little poach job.	1
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.	He didn't kill her.	1
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?	Sounds good.	1
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.	How much time do they get to spend with their dad?	1
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.	This.  Above all.	0
What?	No...as a matter of fact...	0
Where we goin'?	No.	0
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.	Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.	1
Business.	With your gun?...	0
The city?  New York City?  Why?	Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.	0
I don't want to talk about it...	Sheila?!	1
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyíre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.	Someone will come.	1
It's not nonsense.	But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?	1
What people?	Go wash glasses if you don't like it.	0
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!	You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!	1
Was there anyone that I know?	I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....	0
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.	Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.	0
Hi again, how's it going?	They're discussing it.	0
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--	When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.	0
The day you got me out of jail?	Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!	0
What if I call you Nicky?	My wife used to call me that.	1
It's all right.	I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...	0
Did *you* give that acorn its power?	What're you -- what?	0
Helen.	You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.	1
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --	You didn't tell her?	1
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.	Turn around.	0
What kind of backup do we have?	Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.	0
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?	What?	0
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?	It's not a compliment.	0
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !	Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!	0
No, stay.  Please stay with me.	Honey, I gotta start makin' money.	1
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.	Even when you say the things, there's always more things.	1
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.	I think that's what I'm saying.	0
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.	What do you mean?	1
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, weíre the past. Iím not sure if you noticed, but Iím here with someone else.	Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereís something not quite right.	1
Oh yeah?	Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.	0
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.	Oh, well, then you better listen to him.	1
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.	What?	1
Do you think I did it?	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.	1
That guy rules!	Are they still together?	0
And you--	You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.	0
Make up your mind.	My brother, Tom Hagen.	0
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.	It's going to be okay.	1
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.	Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.	1
To you, too?	What do you mean?	1
Yes...	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?	0
I don't like horror movies!	How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.	1
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?	Want company?	0
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?	How can you help us?	1
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...	Who cares ?	1
How'd you find out?	All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.	1
That's right.	Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?	1
Really? Well, let it rip.	Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --	1
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.	And the money goes--	1
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?	Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.	1
Huh! Donít you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.	I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...	1
Naturally I think so.	Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?	0
That's because you grew up rich.	Some reality.	0
It was a long time ago.	Are you busy on Friday?	0
Long enough.  Fifteen years.	Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.	0
What?	You know what we ought to do tonight?	1
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?	Course not.	0
Mm-hm.	In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.	0
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.	How will they know we're coming?	1
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.	I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.	1
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.	That's so.	1
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.	Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.	1
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.	You didn't answer my question.	0
Some people say children need human mothering.	Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.	1
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.	Against what?	1
Linda Cooksey?	Bermuda... Rich, eh?	0
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?	That true, Fergus? You in love?	0
What! Who?	You're Pam?	0
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?	We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.	0
Finn -	I'm cold.	1
Do you still want me to stay?	Yes.	1
No...	What?	0
Yeah, come on, play it.	I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.	0
Like love?	Could be. The physical substance of love.	1
Can I go too?	Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.	1
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.	Why didn't you live together?	1
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.	Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.	1
Okay.	We were just looking.	0
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.	It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...	0
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.	You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?	1
Well, good night, Louis.	Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...	0
Oh yes.	And my nose...	1
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.	You know I can't.	0
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.	Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.	0
He... didn't have me..  I told you-	You didn't marry him for love.	1
No.  Who's Art Mooney?	He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...	1
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.	0
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.	I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.	1
Fries.	Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?	0
Can we go up to the crime scene?	You know you can't do that.  C'mon.	1
Spangler says we have a relationship.	What?	1
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.	Hi.	0
We?	Mmmmm...	0
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...	Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.	1
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.	I guess so.	0
Where's the cabin?	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.	1
I'm heading out of town.	Okay.	1
No Jeffrey!!	Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.	1
I'm married!	Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.	1
You sod.	Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?	0
They just wanted to say hello.	... Friggin' fish.	1
It was him.  I'm positive.	Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.	0
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.	I just picked them up on the way over...	0
I would think so.	Yeah, I would think so, too.	1
Where's Corbett?	Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.	1
And...what's the man doing?	This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!	0
I bet you don't sound like real people.	Did I ever talk about the accident?	0
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?	Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.	0
I smiled at him.	They rival the angels of paradise.	0
I suppose.	Later.  Gotta get paid.	0
No, the reason I ask is--	Oh, sure!	0
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.	I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!	0
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.	Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.	1
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.	It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.	0
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.	It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.	0
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?	A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.	1
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?	...I'm sure that people are upset...	1
Don't.	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.	0
Who are you?	Now, really -	1
Ryan.	Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.	0
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?	Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?	0
Shelly's already told me all about sex.	She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.	1
We're not going.	No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?	0
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?	No...as a matter of fact...	0
Oh, thanks.	Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.	1
No.	Uh...	0
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.	Here? In Berkeley?	1
I'm Bella.	Okay.	0
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.	I'd better get you down.	0
Oh Jesus.	You never know.	0
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?	Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.	0
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?	No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?	1
There's a piano in the street.	No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.	0
But you're a girl, thank goodness.	Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.	0
What do you want?	I slept with your sister.	0
All moorings are clear, Captain.	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.	1
Nothing.	Do you have the...	1
I'm telling you, it was possessed.	Theo, did you see the animal?	1
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.	[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	0
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.	Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.	1
From who?	No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.	0
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!	But who?  Where did you meet him?	1
I am not!	I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.	0
Tell him about the party.	That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.	1
... So... where did you sleep last night?	I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --	1
Ross told me.	Really? What did he say?	1
Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.	1
That macho pompous English --	Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.	1
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...	Whattaya think you're in now?	1
Nobody told me anything.	No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.	0
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.	I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.	1
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.	I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!	0
No.	Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.	1
You mean they don't have hookers.	Yeah. What about the kids' school?	0
Once a week?	That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miamió  for the love of it?	0
I guess.	You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?	0
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.	Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.	0
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!	Now Betty, don't overreact.	1
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.	What are you talkin' a- ?	1
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?	No.	1
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?	And you accused her of tampering with your mail.	0
I'm listening.	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.	0
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.	So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--	1
Hello--	Scared, huh?	0
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.	Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!	1
Egypt.	They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....	0
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.	1
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...	I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...	1
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!	Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.	0
Where're you going to go?	You've <u>got</u> to say it!	0
You weren't gonna say goodbye?	Your birth stone.  I thought --	0
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.	Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.	1
Benjamin, is this your first time?	Is this -- what?	1
What does that mean for Evan?	Yeah, gal I been here before.	0
Is she all right?	I'm just looking.	0
With Trina.	I called Trina.	1
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?	No. I am a "tubab."	1
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.	Me, too.	1
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.	Do you want to go on?	0
Why did you leave so soon?	I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.	0
The Wizard of Gore?	Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.	1
I mean really, deeply angry...	I don't think I could be.	1
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.	Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--	0
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...	...since I used to take you to the Proms?	1
Through the sweats or not?	Not.	1
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.	Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.	1
What if someone tries to steal it?	I'll guard them and you with my life.	1
She ever pull down her shades?	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.	1
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.	It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.	0
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.	No.	0
Well, what is your definition of following?	Following is different. I was spying.	1
Thirty -five years!	Then after that it's safe.	1
What do they want?	They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.	1
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!	I did kill us. She thinks weíre dead. And she thinks she got away with it.	1
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.	I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.	1
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.	0
Yes!	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.	0
Yeah.	Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?	0
Where's he going?	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.	0
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.	Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.	1
That vase.	Shit, I'm sorry.	1
No!	It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.	1
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.	Would you read for us the time of the purchase?	0
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.	Calm down, Frances.	1
Hello?	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.	1
No.	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?	1
And?	Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.	0
...Don't you drink?	Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?	0
Right... You have a boat.	Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.	1
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?	Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.	0
What?	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.	0
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.	Yeah, well --	0
I've got to think of Emily -	I'd like to talk to you about that.	1
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?	Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.	1
No, really?	Right... OK...	0
I'm trying to be your friend.	I know.	1
I took the kids to my sister's.	We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...	0
It looks like white's game.	We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.	1
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.	People watched the movies in their cars?	1
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.	Because I'm in love with you.	0
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!	She's pretty special.	0
Nothing.	Then why are you backing up?	1
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.	Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?	1
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.	You went through Edmunds' things?	0
Hello, Brigman.	Hello, Mrs. Brigman.	1
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.	Well, I wasn't going to say that --	0
Excuse me?	One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.	0
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.	You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.	0
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.	Loretta, what are you talking about?	1
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?	What?	0
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?	Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -	0
Sure. It'd be fun.	Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!	1
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.	I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.	0
Well, I am.	He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.	0
Sorry.	Oh?	0
Water...water...	Water...water -- oh, you already said that.	1
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.	Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.	0
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.	Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.	1
What the hell are you doing, Blade?	We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.	1
Yeah.	This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?	1
Walter?	Yes?	1
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.	This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...	0
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screeningÖ	OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.	1
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.	No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.	1
The hell I can't!	You won't keep growing at this rate.	0
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.	I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.	0
No dances, just tell me.	You're talking nonsense.	0
Would you like something? Some coffee?	What is it?	0
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...	1
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?	Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.	1
It was different then.	My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.	1
<u>Adolph</u>?	Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.	0
You can bring ONE toy...	Hey.	0
He's coming?	You better go.	1
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!	1
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?	Alright?	0
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.	Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.	0
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.	Oh.  I thought... you lead me --	0
But we fought.	Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...	0
You look like you're something on the lanes.	Theo's bowled on the tour.	1
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!	If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.	1
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.	You wanna come?	1
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --	So you had sex with him?	1
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.	'Course I do, they're my brothers.	0
Do I really feel like... I am...?	Yes.  Yes.	1
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?	Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?	1
In your car	Why not.	1
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.	Habit, mostly, just like this.	0
Oh, God...	I called your room from downstairs.	1
Wanna kiss me, Jim?	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.	0
What's the matter?	We're running out of beer and other supplies.	1
I have that date -- remember?	I love you -- remember?	1
Where'd you get all that information?	I don't know.	0
Love it.	Some Italian I picked up back there. Heís in the boot of the Mustang.	0
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.	That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"	0
Natasha?	No.  Doris.	1
I don't understand.	Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.	0
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.	A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.	0
They left.	A parting gift from the Empire.	0
For emphasis?	What is a sip of coffee going to do?	0
And you believe him?	We established that we have no communication.	0
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.	But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.	1
Sidney, what happened?	Nevermind, what'd you two find?	1
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.	What?	0
Sex with Simon?	I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.	0
Like what?	You crazy? Hit him with what?	0
That's a lot of ground to cover.	I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!	0
You're famous around here.	I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.	0
Did you get some sleep?	Sure.	1
Where are you going?	But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.	0
Charming. More delightful people crippled.	What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.	0
Surprise.	Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --	0
I'll go.	Do I actually *see* this--?	0
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.	That's not what I was worried about.	1
You're saying you need money.	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!	1
What, and get myself beaten up again?	I just need you to be safe.	0
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.	1
It's for school, for summer writing class.	Any more soda left?	1
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.	Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?	1
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.	Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...	1
I...I don't know...	Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.	1
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...	I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.	1
Got a problem with that?	Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?	1
To who?	Doesn't matter.	1
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!	1
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.	He left with Sophie.	1
How young?	Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.	1
Yeah.	He can't manifest.	0
It looks....foreign.	What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.	0
It's my fucking life.	No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.	0
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.	1
Are you having an affair?	Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?	1
I have thought about it, yes.	You bitch. I knew it.	1
Yes, what?	Don't answer me. Say what I say.	1
Well, why don't you say it?	Me? Sure. Why?	0
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --	I'll take you home if you'd like.	1
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?	1
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.	Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.	0
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.	No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...	0
It pays.	You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?	0
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.	Yeah, I know.	1
Yeah, I guess you're right.	I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.	1
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.	Bingo?	0
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --	In aid of what?	1
Hello.	It's me.	1
All stop, sir.	You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...	0
Peter, what about the bathtub?	Rockville Center.	0
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?	Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.	1
So who you taking to the prom?	Huh?	1
So the chest is still out there somewhere.	Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.	1
Hi, Jack.	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.	0
Kevin, this is serious!	You got in.	1
Mulholland Drive.	Not our mystery guest again.	0
Hey, Joel --	-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.	1
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.	I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.	1
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.	Some sacrifices are worth it.	1
You promised justice.	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?	1
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.	It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.	1
Don't you care?	There's very little I can do about it.	1
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.	That dazzling imagination.	0
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.	Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.	0
Um. Thirty-seven.	Right: Lovers of the world unite!	0
... What does that mean?	He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.	1
Oh.	Okay!!!! Anything else?!?	0
Could be a fishing boat.	Too big. More like a freighter.	1
I remember you.	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...	0
Mr Poe?	I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.	0
That's easy. Me.	I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight óówalk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!	1
No. That's all finished.	Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.	0
He killed her.	What?	1
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.	Sport, indeed.	1
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.	Not your...	0
Yeah.	Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!	0
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?	Come over tomorrow and read it to me?	1
These appointments were not my idea, remember.	True. Should we stop them?	1
Thank you.	Right.	1
I'm sorry -- I can't --	What?	1
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.	Datura.	0
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.	Would four of them -- ?	0
Don't you think you should at least wave?	Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?	1
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.	What's the matter?	1
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.	1
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!	I'm fine... I'm fine...	1
I want to go home.	You can't.	1
Nor you for me.	Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.	1
Guess what"s under these coconuts.	What?	1
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.	Keep it.	1
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."	Where do I sign?	0
Well, how'd you get here?	Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.	0
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.	Just let me get a match.	0
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.	Good-bye, look in your backpack.	0
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?	Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.	1
What are you doing?	This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.	1
I can't go any farther.	Yeah.	0
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.	0
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --	You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.	1
NO! Don't believe him.	I do. God's truth. I do.	0
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.	Hi.	0
I didn't get any chicken.	This isn't about me anymore.	0
Which means he's having nightmares again?	You attacked me.	0
How do you that.	Magic...	1
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.	Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.	0
Come back some other time, will you?	It's a pretty piece of land.	0
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.	It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.	0
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.	Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.	1
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.	Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?	0
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.	0
I just hope this is still good up there.	Mom?	1
He is.	Do you have something to drink?	0
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.	But...	0
I suppose...	Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.	1
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.	What for?	0
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."	It was the bars, then.	1
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?	Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.	1
What?	That's a ridiculous move.	1
Oh.	Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?	1
No. What are you looking for?	I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?	0
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.	Don't leave me...	0
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.	This is funny.	0
Well... sure...	What's that for?	0
Crash...I want you.	Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?	1
...gger.	We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.	0
I'm not sure... I don't know.	Don't touch anything.	0
Oh God... what did we do?	Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!	1
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.	Sure.	0
But all ends well.	Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.	0
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?	I'm breaking no promises!	0
All right. Now finish your drink.	Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.	1
What did you do with your dog?	Kurt's been feeding him.	1
Where are you going now?	Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.	0
Get on this, right now...	...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...	1
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.	No.	1
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.	Anything. Anything at all.	0
Guess I did.	Haven't slept, have you?	1
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?	With all of it?	0
What's in the satchel?	Yeah --	0
I hate outside! I hate it!	Tell me your name?	0
Why, may I ask?	That's the question I want to ask Job.	1
Did you like it, dear?	You're not ready.	0
I think it worked out okay, donít you?	Sure.  I really like Annie.	1
Oh...ungghhhhh!	Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.	1
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.	Am I what they had in mind?	1
Will they?	You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.	0
Then what is he?	big subject with me, yeah.	0
It's all right.	Cry-baby?	0
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.	I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?	0
How... how was Miss Caswell?	I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.	0
Well, okay. I got you some.	Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?	0
What a stupid idea.	Why?	1
It's two weeks.	Almost three.	1
He said you didn't have one.	What's he talking about?	1
There are three men dead.	So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.	1
How about the coke?	No.	1
Girlfriend?	No.	1
Who's there?	Yeah let's hear about your day.	0
What is with you tonight?	Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.	0
The doctor'll be back in a minute.	Nona, please.	1
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.	When?	0
Hi, Joey.	The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.	0
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.	Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.	1
So you like bookstores, huh?	Well. Hope you enjoy it.	0
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.	Well, let's go down and ask him.	0
You dance...	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?	0
WHERE IS IT ?	THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !	1
I didn't realize I was out.	I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.	0
Do you miss her?	Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.	1
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.	No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.	1
Do you remember what you said?	Yes. I said this is too good to live...	1
Major, Major... he's here ...	Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.	1
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...	Look at this.	0
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.	Well, we must be who we must be...	1
Aren't you?	Frankly - yes.	1
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!	Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --	0
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?	Do you know why I'm here?	0
-- Your employer?	And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.	0
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.	I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.	0
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.	Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.	1
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--	Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.	0
They get some turnout for this stuff.	Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?	0
About a year and a half.	Were you with him last night?	1
You took care of your wife, like you do me?	I tried.	1
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.	What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.	0
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.	You don't want the police any more than I do.	1
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...	Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.	1
Scottie!	I don't.	0
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.	0
I know.	I'll hitch.	0
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.	Forget how to ride a bike.	0
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.	Sure, hon.	1
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.	Yeah.	1
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.	That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.	1
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.	What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?	1
Hood residence.	Charles, what time is it?	1
And they just answer them?	Mostly. Sometimes they do things.	1
They all are. Football's on.	Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.	0
Your clothing reeks of it.	Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.	0
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.	I bet you did.	1
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.	Yes.	0
Old Howard Winton's cub?	I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.	0
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.	You think?	1
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?	Almost five.	1
Hello?	Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.	1
You 're so --	Pleasant?	1
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!	Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...	0
Alvy, I...	What-what-what-what's the matter?	1
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?	Maybe.	1
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.	Hmm.	1
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?	Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.	0
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.	The...	1
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?	Okay...oh!	1
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!	Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!	0
You're late, George.	I gotta talk to you.	1
What?	I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.	0
Do you practice here?	No, San Francisco. What are you...?	1
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.	So I just take your word?	0
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?	Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --	0
That's good, honey.	Why not?	0
God, isn't he great?	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.	0
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.	Just... keep where you are.	0
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.	The "man" again.	0
What're you doin', baby?	I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.	0
Oh, it is?	Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.	1
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?	My lady mocks me.	1
No, I'm going home.	Pink.	0
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.	Mine's the Eleventh.	1
Is there anything more I could --	Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?	0
Who's your decorator?	Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.	1
You don't think so? I do.	I'm... not... a... killer.	0
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.	We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?	0
Do what?	Move to Mars.	1
No.	Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.	0
All his life.  He's tried everything.	Still clear?	1
Surveillance? By whom?	Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.	1
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?	0
My grandchild-baby.	Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?	1
We want it back.	It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.	0
Ray?... What time is it?	Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?	0
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.	But we can't just dig it up!	0
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.	What?	1
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.	What are you drinking?	0
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?	I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...	0
I want you to forget what I said.	This is true love. You think this happens every day?	0
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --	You should have told them he'd disappeared.	1
Where have you been?	I'm sorry, I been real busy.	1
Yes.	So you, like, come from a town like this or...?	0
Yes?	One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.	0
They care about you. They're just a different generation.	I'm going to bed now.	0
Where do I meet you?	Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?	1
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.	Nah.	0
Okay.	Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?	1
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?	I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-	0
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?	Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.	0
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.	I know, I know, I know.	0
I can't tell you.	What?	0
No, you're not a guy.	I am.	1
I promise.	And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?	0
What can I say? He does weird things to me.	Ernie's.	0
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?	Well, that don't do me one bit of good!	0
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.	Can I have something to drink?	1
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.	Did you tell anybody?	0
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.	How long were you in there?	0
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!	And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...	0
Yeah, well, I check out today.	You're not accompanying him to New York?	1
Why don't you?	No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.	1
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?	Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?	0
You want some company?	Sure.	1
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.	In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.	1
Uh-huh.	And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.	0
No, Sandro... Please...	Why?	1
They'll run you out.	I lied. Wait for it...	0
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?	Fallout shelter.	1
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --	I just saw a man walk out of your room!	0
That's an evasion.	Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.	0
Oh there you are.	Oh! You caught me.	1
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.	Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.	0
How are you going to pay when you get sick?	But then you've been so much better...	0
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.	Is that what he tells you?	0
That's right.  What's she doing?	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.	1
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?	1
It's you. You and your father.	No --	1
Don?	No.	1
You never called me back.  I left messages.	Dorothy. No!	0
What is?	Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.	1
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.	Of course.	1
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!	Yeah, well --	1
But she's --	It does?	0
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.	Women?  No... not really.	0
But you're not enrolled.	I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"	0
Are you riding with me, James?	No, I'm going ho --	1
Yes?	I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.	0
What are you wearing?	Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.	1
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.	Wendy...	0
Don't mention it.	It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.	1
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.	Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.	1
Benjamin?	I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?	1
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.	Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!	1
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.	It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.	0
All right. Now let's get to bed.	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?	1
That was really bad, wasn't it?	Disgusting.	1
Wow!	Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.	0
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.	You are?  She's glad I called!	0
Ha...	Who is it?	0
Do you feel good about it?	No.	1
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?	Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?	1
You're horrible	You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.	1
That was so weak.	Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.	1
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.	Did you give her the money?	0
And beat it at it's own game.	You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.	1
Sonny kicks ass.	You do business in Cuba with your husband?	0
It's for the party, Dad --	Ten?	0
You want a Dairy Queen?	So now you suddenly care about my future?	0
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.	I don't need sleep!	1
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --	No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.	1
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.	It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.	0
What do you mean?	Tubab means white man.	1
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?	Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.	1
I just don't.	What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.	1
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.	1
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.	Well--sure, I could do that--	1
Do you still have that doctor's number?	Impotent.	0
I consider it less my failure than his.	Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.	1
Thank you.	The pepper, too?	1
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.	That's frustrating.	1
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until itís light out.	And be crushed.	0
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?	Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.	1
You're totally insane.	Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.	1
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!	You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.	0
Apipoulai!	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...	1
Why would we do that?	I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?	1
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?	Doesn't matter.	0
Am I as good as they?	Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.	0
Why was the maid crying?	I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?	1
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.	I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.	1
I think he'll find that satisfying.	Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.	1
Not even a stalemate?	Like the quiche?	0
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.	They're none of them right.	1
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.	Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?	0
-- especially one like this.	And I am...	1
What?	No. I'm a gardener.	0
You wouldn't.	All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.	0
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...	They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.	1
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.	I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --	1
Jeffrey? What's going on?	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...	0
You think they're still up there?	If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.	1
Why wouldn't you think that about me?	Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --	1
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--	Be my guest.	1
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?	Well...	0
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.	1
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?	Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?	0
How long have you been doing this?	Yes, it does.	0
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?	0
Um...	What?	1
I totally heard you did.	I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.	1
Neo!	What the hell just happened?	1
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnít think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.	I didn't mean to...	0
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.	The main guy, Dieter--	0
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.	And what if you don't?	1
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldíve happened if you hadnít stepped in at the store.	This is crazy.	0
No....I though  I'm afraid.	I guess we'll just have to evolve too.	0
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.	Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.	1
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?	You're ruthless.	1
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.	I know.	1
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.	1
Jimmy, did you touch her?	I don't know.	1
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.	I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.	0
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?	You forgot to be there.	1
Oh, well.	East coast people are different.	0
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?	Yes.	0
Don't you think we have enough?	Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.	1
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.	What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?	0
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..	I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.	1
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!	What?	1
Go for a walk in Central Park --	Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?	0
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.	What?	0
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.	But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.	0
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.	Why? People fart backwards.	0
Yes.	No.	0
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.	No.	0
You hear me? I believed you.	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?	1
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.	God, you... you're mean.	1
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.	Jean-I'm not-	0
Yeah?	Mickey Spillane.	0
This is a mammal, not a fish.	Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.	1
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.	Of what?	0
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.	My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.	1
Not yet, Mr. Clark.	Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.	0
Can you stay for dinner?	Depends on what I'd give up on.	1
A friend dropped me off.	Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.	0
How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.	1
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.	Okay.	0
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!	I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.	0
Oh. What happens now?	Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.	1
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.	Jesus, if someone had --	1
Your portable reed organ....the piano.	Well, it's fine. Thank you.	1
Where?	Let me guess.  Clarinet?	0
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?	Baby, don't do this. I do love you.	1
What will you do?	I have to go back to Birmingham.	1
These are good.	What?	0
You've never said that before.	No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...	0
You hear me? I believed you.	No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.	0
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --	Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.	0
You don't know?	Isn't that great?	0
I vote for the motel.	My kinda group!	1
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.	He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.	1
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.	Really?  What did White say?	1
Where you headed?	I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.	1
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?	I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.	1
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?	How come you don't stay with them?	0
I'm babbling.	Easy now... That mare's in season.	0
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?	They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.	1
It looks like the furnace.	Let's get outta here.	1
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?	I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.	0
I mean, romantically.	Uh-huh.  Well, but if --	1
When we're making love?	Yes.	1
What do I have to do to stop it?	All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."	0
His name was Jimmy.	What happened?	1
Daddy!	Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.	0
What kind of a horrible thing is that?	It still worked in town.	1
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...	It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?	0
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.	No.	1
You didn't say what it was for, did you?	No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?	1
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.	I will see you at suppertime, Rose.	1
But would you--would you--	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.	0
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--	No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.	0
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.	1
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --	Okay. All right.  And what do I say?	0
M'hm.	so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.	1
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.	Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.	0
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.	Can you help me?	1
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.	I'll be right up.	0
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.	1
Alright.	Yes, I would.	0
Yes.	No.	0
ìLa collectionooseî. Itís about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Itís on TV tonight and as Iím in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says itís about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directorís supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?	What did they say?	0
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.	You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.	1
Well... it started with the play before this one...	I love you, Elaine.	0
But how are you going to escape?	Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...	0
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!	No. You like the way I do things.	0
Why?	Where? In the leg?	0
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?	Excuse me?	0
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.	You could check. It'd be in his files.	0
Where are you gonna go?	Hearsay.	0
Walter can I ask you something?	What!	1
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.	The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.	1
The moon?	The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.	1
Ted, I'm leaving you.	That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!	1
Please!... that's not like you.	Yeah, I know. Did you?	1
I do.	I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.	1
Yes.	Then you go to the left. There's a landing.	1
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.	I buy them flowers.	0
...what the fuck is this...?	It's a huge moment in their life --	0
She was so great, why'd you leave her?	You think it's simple, huh?	0
We're going to Jersey?	East Rutherford.	1
Be good and be smart, little boy.	Yes, ma'm...	1
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?	The way you just looked at me...	0
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.	1
It never did.	Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.	0
Yes.	Is that Donald Trump's car?	0
But no one knew until after...	After I...	1
But if she dies...	It's only mortal death.	1
Tomorrow is the full moon.	That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.	1
Copy. And Lundegaard too.	I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.	0
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.	So we need two people, two women.	0
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?	Tell her.	0
Did she talk about me?	No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.	1
How was it?	I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.	0
Don't you care?	By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.	0
You're going too?	I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.	0
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.	No, you can't go out.	0
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?	Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!	1
No, I have my things in the car.	Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.	1
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.	You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.	1
Okay.	It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.	1
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...	That's good.	1
Daddy!	Hi, Allison --	1
No... it's in shadow.	What else?	1
Will you meet with him?	Yeah. From the likes of them.	0
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.	1
But they'd still get the idea, right?	It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.	0
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!	I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?	0
I was talking to Jim.	Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--	1
I don't like sugar	There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?	1
Only answers to me.	Do you have to be so damn forthright?	0
Hi.	Hi.	1
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.	Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.	0
Guess I should have been telling your father.	So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.	1
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.	No, I don't.	1
Did that help? Did you learn anything?	We established that we have no communication.	1
I'm sorry Charlie.	Then I know my alphabet.	0
Last time you were gone for a week!	I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.	0
Sonofabitch!	Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.	1
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.	Ma'am?	1
This is where we're going!	Sure.	0
Then what are you scared of, honey?	I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.	1
What're you doing here, Roy?	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.	0
Well, what the hell does that mean?	Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.	0
When did you decide all this?	Always.  Ever since the day I died.	0
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.	Our Lady of Misery.	0
Yeah?	-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.	1
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.	And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.	0
I don't want to hear it.	You left your keys in the ignition.	0
Did you make any change in this room?	I don't think so.	1
So, like your father, you changed the rules...	If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!	1
Charlie? Was I dead?	They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?	0
Mitch...	Shhh. Shhh.	1
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?	Nothing.	1
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.	I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.	1
Apipoulai!	No, thanks.	0
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?	Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!	1
Huh?	...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?	1
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.	Do as I say. Let go!	0
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.	Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame--	1
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.	It's not that.	1
Honey?	Well, all wars do -	0
He's afraid of something.	Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?	0
Go to the police station!	Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.	1
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.	Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...	0
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.	I don't want to talk about this here.	0
She's mistaken.	Sshhh...	0
You mean the time you're locked away?	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.	0
You don't have to do that.	I know.	1
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...	Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.	1
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?	I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.	0
I said I was sorry.	[Beat] Yeah, it is.	0
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.	Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.	0
How's Paco doing?	He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.	1
We're going awfully far.	I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?	1
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?	Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.	1
Apipoussan!	Apipoussan?	1
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.	Thanks.	0
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.	Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.	0
What is it?	You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.	0
To a great weekend --	I do ... I cut "em...	0
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!	But we all need that too. Hold him.	0
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.	Like what?	0
I'm okay.	You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?	1
Actually, you may take it all now.	Sylvan can be talked into anything.	0
The what?	You're not them.	0
...You called me this morning.	Yeah.	1
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.	So the headaches may not even be a part of this?	1
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.	Nah.  Don't sweat it.	1
What?!	Of course.	0
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --	The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.	1
I was there, I saw her do it.	<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>	0
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?	Are you asking me if I have something to prove?	1
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.	Oh, crabby guy, huh?	1
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today ó let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?	You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."	1
And how do you know that?	It tastes different.	0
You and Harold are friends?	Little black party dresses?	0
Nicholas...	Shut up!	1
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.	I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.	0
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?	Yeah.	0
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...	Where the money is.	0
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?	What is this, Swana?	0
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.	Well, I wasn't always impotent.	0
What did you use before?	Thorazin.	1
Let me see.	Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.	1
I told you I'd come back.	Yeah.	0
I'm so sorry.	Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.	1
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.	He sure did.	0
No, I didn't...	It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...	1
Every time you and Marlon--	--We could bum around the world for a year on that.	1
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.	Why don't you try suicide?	1
A better friend.	You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.	0
What?	Will you calm down?	0
HELP! HELP!!	I've got you. I won't let go.	1
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.	Well, who's Sadie?	1
Hi.....  Roses.	Me, too.	0
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.	No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.	0
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.	It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.	1
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --	Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.	1
This just isn't the best moment for this.	I know, I know. I had no idea --	1
About things that are important to me.	Like what?	1
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...	Why not?	0
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.	Anything else?	1
So...what did you think of the tape.	I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.	0
God, there's Lester...	Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.	0
What do you get for that?	Hey, what's up.	0
Should we bring the police into this?	No, not yet.	1
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --	Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.	0
I bet you did lots of bad things.	What are you talking about?	1
Dinner's in the oven.	Thank you.  Goodnight.	1
I can do it!	I told you not to read all that crap!	0
Are we going to build our little house?	Yes... a little white house.	1
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.	I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.	1
It will?	No... I'm from France.	0
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."	Not the most popular opinion, but yes.	1
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.	No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.	1
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.	A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.	1
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.	What about Ian?	1
What the hell's his problem?	Eh, fine.	0
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?	Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.	1
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!	Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!	1
The future doesn't look different?	Hundreds! Which one is your pet?	0
What's that?	We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.	0
Thanks a lot.	Oh--*Saunders*!	1
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.	Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!	1
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.	It's already out.	1
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-	Well...	1
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!	I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.	1
Damn.	You'll have to drive -- except down hill.	0
This knife is filthy.	What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?	1
You're not worried that someone might take him?	Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.	1
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.	Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.	0
How long will you set it for this time?	Gone.	0
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.	1
Is that written in his shoe?	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...	1
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!	I was mistaken.	1
She's not accustomed to being ignored.	I think I should.  3000W?	0
Landon. I can't even do for myself.	But if you could, you would?	1
What's that mean?	I sure would.	0
Away.	My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....	0
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.	1
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.	Is it gone?	1
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.	Sure.	0
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!	Where are we?	0
Fifteen.	Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.	1
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?	It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.	1
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.	But you put yourself on the circuit!	0
No bodies, no West...	No death certificates. No crime.	1
Are you tired of it?	Do you want us to come in the kitchen?	0
That's crazy -- why not?	Aw, come, come, come --	0
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.	What. What don't I understand?	0
He's doing the best he can, Charles.	What else is there?	0
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...	I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.	0
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?	Oh, it's fine. Fine.	1
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.	I don't understand.	0
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.	I just want to ask some questions.	0
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!	1
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.	I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.	1
What's the matter?	You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.	1
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.	The pleasure is mine, madame.	0
Do you know what youíre doing?	What's your being married got to do with it?	0
Well that's a ... long story ...	I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.	0
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?	Erin --	1
Here.	Oh.	0
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.	I don't know.	0
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.	What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.	1
I should leave.	But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.	1
Not as a rule.	You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?	0
What do you mean?	I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!	1
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --	What are you?	0
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.	Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.	0
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.	That's what therapists are for, right?	1
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?	Uh, if the guy wants to.	1
Ugh, what's that smell?	Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.	0
Are you alright?	Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.	1
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.	Take it easy.	0
You do! You definitely do.	Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.	1
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?	It's over, Evelyn. It's all over	0
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.	Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.	0
Cream rinse?	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!	0
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.	Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?	1
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.	No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.	0
You're scared.	I'm not scared.	1
Why not?	Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.	0
Does that make it right...	If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.	0
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.	You hate that.	0
What will happen if I do?	I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.	0
Just for fun?	I guess so.	1
Answer the question, please.	Did she say that?	0
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...	You got a suspect...	1
So how's Norman?	Maude?	0
This isn't a game.	Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.	1
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.	Always.  Ever since the day I died.	1
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.	Oh, Charlie again.	0
Hi.	Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?	1
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.	I touched a nerve.	0
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.	You do?	1
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...	Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.	0
Can we see it from the back yard?	You can get the general idea...	1
Should I use the last bullets on us?	I'm not Bill Mitchell.	0
Leave him alone, Tim.	A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.	0
Can I see your I.D.?	Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...	0
There must be a phone around here somewhere.	Terrific.	0
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.	Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!	0
You like it there, don't you?	How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.	0
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!	And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?	0
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.	It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?	1
I wouldn'tve asked --	I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.	0
Thank you.	Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?	1
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.	No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.	1
So this is something between you and him?	He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.	1
What -- ?	You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --	1
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?	Yeah, baby.	0
Yes, you asshole.	You sure those doors will be open?	0
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.	They serve dinner on the flight?	1
What did you study?	Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?	1
You're lying.	Okay thanks, atta girl.	0
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.	0
A moonstone.	I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.	0
Do you know it like that? By heart.	Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.	0
A dive? You mean, into the water?	Naw, in the ring, a dive is-	1
Those things in your hands.	That's my girl.	0
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.	Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.	1
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.	...just like that?	0
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	Now I know...	1
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.	I don't get it.	1
And you've got me all figured out?	Sure.	1
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!	Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.	1
So you're gonna bitch up?	What's that supposed to be, psychology?	1
I need my paycheck.	You can still work.	1
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.	"Time is money" -- please.	0
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?	No?	0
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?	Yeah.	1
Closer to eight.	But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.	0
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --	Who is this man? You're engaged!	0
I was a slave.	Oh, go on.	0
Julliard, yeah.	Ernie's.	0
This is ridiculous!	Tim!	1
I want you to take this... to remember by.	Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?	0
I wouldn't have let you.	Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?	1
Of course.	You do that.	0
Please.	Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.	0
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?	You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.	0
You have to smoke so early in the morning?	They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?	0
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.	Gimme the God damn ball!	0
What?!	It's all I think about anymore.	0
Yes.	Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!	0
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.	Including you?	0
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.	Marge, you like everybody.	0
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.	Beth -- gimme the gun.	1
And Bourne? Where's he now?	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?	1
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, butó you've been very kind.	Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.	1
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.	Good luck, Tracy.	0
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..	It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?	0
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.	Great.	0
That was a pity...	You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.	0
Hang up the phone.	Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?	0
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.	Will you take of f your blouse?	0
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.	Go you Huskies...	1
Not if you don't grow up...	All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?	0
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.	Then I will go with you.	1
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --	Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.	0
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.	Would you like a bite of my pie?	0
Where we goin'?	Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.	1
Suppress it.	Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.	0
Take it back. Till you sell your book.	There're no cars on this street.	0
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.	Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.	1
You don't care if I die	Sure, I do	1
Where's West? New Jersey?	I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.	0
...taping?  What are you taping?	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.	0
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.	What makes you so sure?	1
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.	And nothing will ever change that.	1
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.	We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.	1
You had a son.	It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.	0
I'm not crowding you, am I?	Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.	0
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.	What?	0
As much as you used to?	Yellow Room where they dance --	0
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.	A joker to the end.	1
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.	I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.	1
Don't.	Claire, I have to show up for the--	1
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.	I'll take your word for it.	1
Fine.  That's great.	Is that it?	1
Yes.	Move him.	1
This time it's for real?	Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.	0
Oh, Wade.	Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.	0
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.	That's good.	1
Hello?	Lena?	1
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.	0
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?	They're dumb things. I got tired of them.	1
That was gas, Sweetie.	I thought you were a dyke.	0
Is anything missing?	Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.	0
They don't know?	No -- they don't.	1
Like what?	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?	0
Thank-you.  The real world.	Look at those eyes.	1
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.	It was kind of funny.	1
I want you to try something with me, okay?	Yearse!	0
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.	Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.	0
'Cause you don't lose loads?	Mm. And your like, what else?	0
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?	Then after that it's safe.	0
Could it be some kind of college initiation?	It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!	1
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.	I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.	0
Somerset Maugham.	Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.	1
Bluebeard!	Twenty-five wives!	1
What?	Most people don't have my kind of problems.	0
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.	Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.	1
May I talk to you?	Sure...	1
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.	All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?	0
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.	That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-	0
Joel? It's Joel, right?	Um-huh.	0
Honey, you all right?	It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!	1
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.	Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?	0
Go ahead, say it.	No.  I got lucky with the lights.	1
All set.	You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?	1
What do you think happened on this boat?	I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?	1
I'll do my best.	Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.	0
It's not mine.	Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -	0
I just want to know where he is.	No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.	0
This has nothing to do with you.	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.	0
They would have killed you too.	Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.	0
It was great.	Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--	0
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.	Mr. Gardiner...	0
Frances?	If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?	0
Fuck you.	Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.	1
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?	I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.	1
What do you mean?	I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.	1
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?	What do you mean?	0
Honest to goodness, I hate you.	Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!	0
What the crap?	It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?	1
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.	I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.	0
I told you! Right here!	Did they hurtcha?	0
What about the phosphorous grenade?	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.	0
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.	Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?	1
You know better than to interrupt me.	It's over, Evelyn. It's all over	0
No.	Oh. Is that how you met him?	0
Oh please.	I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there	0
Where you wanted to be?	The timing has never seemed quite right.	0
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.	I do not.	1
You mentioned that in your letters	You didn't see that one comin', did ya?	0
Tell me about him.	That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!	0
Do you really mean that?	Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.	1
hey.	Like?	0
The bomb, asshole!	Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.	0
Johnny, I have something to tell you.	I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.	1
What's this?	So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?	0
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.	He's having an early night.	0
I'll get the book.	Some people got faces that stick in your mind.	0
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?	Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...	1
Faster, faster!	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!	1
If you want to look at it that way...	How would you look at it?	1
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!	My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -	0
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.	Did you tell anybody?	1
Fuck, it's freezing.	Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.	0
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.	You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.	0
You wouldn't.	No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.	1
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.	Yeah, we have something great, Vick.	1
Did he say anything to you?	How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.	0
So you were cheated.	No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.	1
How d'you mean?	Well, I don't get on so well most places.	1
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.	I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?	0
It's so pretty.	Yeah.	1
Which side do you like?	You choose.	1
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.	Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.	1
You are such a wet.	Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.	0
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?	Ernie's.	1
You just said very food.	Ryan's novel?	0
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.	Yah?	0
Take it slowly.	So damn stupid.	1
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?	Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?	1
What if he did?	He's probably the only one who can help us.	0
It must be my new shampoo.	That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?	1
Okay then...	Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?	1
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.	What's so great about baseball?	1
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?	I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --	0
I don't know.  I can't be alone.	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.	0
What's wrong with Parker?	How should I know?	1
Excuse me. Excuse me!	I'll just be a minute.	0
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.	Victoria.	0
...don't talk.	It's pleasant down that way, too.	1
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.	You blaming God. That what you're doing?	1
How?	Can you fix it?	0
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.	Funny.	1
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?	Yes.	1
Hi, Sean.	Work.  The things I need to get done.	0
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.	No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnít we?	0
No.	People home.	1
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --	It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.	1
Do you still...see each other?	Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.	1
When?	When I get off work.	1
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?	Then come with me.	1
Poor woman...	I might have to look into that...	0
-- his car. They have it blocked.	Jill.	0
I'll drop it!	And this is your "work"?	0
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.	So what are you saying?	1
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?	"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."	0
Yeah.	It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.	0
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!	Say again?	0
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.	And I think the book is the poorer for it.	0
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.	I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...	1
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go óó right now.  Why are you going to do this?	You don't know?	1
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!	Don't say that, Edie, don't...	0
They go. John. They go.	What's wrong?	1
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?	Helen, I want you to be my wife.	0
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.	You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?	1
I'm gonna go now.	Wendy...	1
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.	I know...I know.	0
What?	I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?	1
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.	And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.	1
What if it's not who you think it is?	If he crosses the bridge, it is.	1
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--	1
Watch this!	Positive?	0
She lives here too?	Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....	1
Thank you.	Now I want you to do something for me.	1
Are you...okay?	It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.	1
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.	You know me...	0
Totally.	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?	0
What's the matter with you?	Whew.	0
Collect me?	What?	0
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.	That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.	1
Yes.	Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?	1
I think there are sixteen there.	Looks like the best man won.	0
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.	You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?	1
It will?	Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.	1
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!	Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?	1
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.	No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.	0
Every time!	You know - I play tenor sax.	1
What do you think? ... is it me?	With a jacked-up attitude.	0
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.	Mom!	0
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!	It's over!	1
Steve, I...	But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...	1
Well, you obviously don't know me.	I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.	1
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.	It is combat. Every second counts.	0
Great?	Yeah.	1
Oh, good. Okay.	My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."	0
How old are you?	Thirty-five.	1
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.	Close every door behind you!	0
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...	Not at all. You're light as a feather.	1
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.	I think goodbye is traditional.	1
I want to know.	Why does anyone want to be in movies?	1
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.	1
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.	I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.	0
You want a drink?	Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'	0
Don't pay to complain.	You on your way home?	1
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.	He doesn't want my help.	1
Well, yes your nose is. Very.	Is it?	1
Marty...	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.	0
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.	1
Who is that other guy?	Yes, no.	0
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.	Start killing people for real?	0
What was that?	You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.	0
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.	OK.	1
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.	What do you actually know with religion?	1
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.	Then you never loved me?	1
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?	Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.	1
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?	Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.	0
He's terribly busy, sir.	I understand.	1
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.	Show her.	0
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?	If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.	1
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?	It doesn't make any difference anymore.	1
What did you study?	Stop it!	0
We'll see.	Okay.  It's good knowing this.	1
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?	True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?	1
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.	1
Who?	What'd you care?	1
Are you mad at me?	No, of course not.	0
I might.	Might?	1
I was her best friend.	Best friend?	1
But we heard him.	We haven't.	0
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.	Yeah. RISC is good.	0
Do you think she's prettier than I?	Who?	1
Tennessee?	Where'd she go?	0
Keep your voice down.	I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.	1
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."	Well, they aren't.	1
Somerset Maugham.	I'm sure you would.	0
You're late.	Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.	0
Hey, Mitch.	Too close.	0
Listen, you're very nice... b...	Alright.  Well, that's something new.	0
What are you doing here?	Because she killed herself!!	0
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...	If you find her...	1
You ever think maybe you have a family?	I thought about it.  I don't know.	1
You asked me to dine with you tonight.	No.	0
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --	Your daughter needs you.  Go.	0
Thank you. Having fun?	Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.	0
You mean the one who --	Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?	0
I think what you did...	What?	1
Daddy, I --	About an hour ago.	0
Thatís good but...you did forget the anniversary.	What?	0
Oh, sh-	Carrie.	0
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....	You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.	1
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?	I want him with me.	0
But, Nathan--	Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!	1
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?	Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.	1
He had his hand on her titty.	Let me look.  Aww-rr...	1
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.	What's gonna happen?	0
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.	Uh-huh.	0
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.	Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?	0
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?	Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --	1
What's it look like?	I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.	0
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?	I don't have one.	0
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?	It's been known to happen.	1
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."	All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.	1
A videotape.	"...for my father."	0
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?	What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?	1
How do you know that?	I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.	1
So why have you told me about it?	I'm sorry.	0
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.	Start of what?	1
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.	Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.	0
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramÈ.	He was pretty drunk, but I think heís still crazy about you.	1
Yeah. But not any more.	Hear this now: I will come for you.	0
Seven years ago.	How many men since then?	1
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.	I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.	0
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.	Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --	1
What -- rape?	Ahhh, but I know you.	0
Well, you're married.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.	0
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.	Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.	0
The leaves...	As in the...?	0
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.	And you ...?	0
Yeah.   He's a good man.	What?	1
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.	It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.	0
-- Can't seem to escape you today.	I'm sorry.	1
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?	Someone else did it.	1
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.	Read me some?	0
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.	That's what you theenk.	1
But you said --	I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.	0
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?	I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...	1
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.	Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.	0
I love you, my little Leonitchka!	Go on - hit me!	0
Now many?	What? What are you saying?	0
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.	I need you to teach me.	1
What's the rush?	I'm fine.	0
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?	I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.	0
How young?	Are you in trouble with the law?	0
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.	And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?	1
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.	You crazy? Hit him with what?	0
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?	The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.	1
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.	I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!	0
Go away!	I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!	0
Where are you going?!	The reactor.	1
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.	Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.	0
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.	Huh...	0
Oh. What about?	...of possibly working together.	1
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.	0
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?	They do, but -- there are no lights out there ó- they'll just be shadows -ó	0
Why?	You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.	1
I don't want to talk about him.	Fine.	1
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.	Italy!	0
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.	Yeah. It could get better.	1
Are you--scared?	I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.	1
Others?	Criminals.	1
Stu?	Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.	0
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.	Never better. You sleep well.	1
You weren't going with her?	No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.	1
Of course.	What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?	1
Why so nervous?	You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?	0
What?	What for?	0
Back to California	Oh, Stanzi.	0
If you came back.	YAAA!	0
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.	You thought I was faking?	1
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?	Let's just say, I never saw E.T.	0
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.	Say, 'Nigger.'	0
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.	Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.	1
What are you doing... ?	Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.	0
You know what you remind me of?	What?	1
Can we look at one?	No.	1
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?	When?	0
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.	I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?	1
Could it be intelligent?	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.	1
Okay.	If not for me, at least for Amy.	1
Haven't seen you around, have I?	But obviously you still care what happens to him.	0
Not in the Nineties.	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.	1
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.	I don't know...	0
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.	Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?	0
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?	I could...	0
What about now?	It's over.  I talked to her this morning.	1
I got bored so I went to the movies.	A Bill! Not *him*!	0
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.	Bullshit.	1
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...	Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.	1
As a representative of Moscow...	No, no...	0
I'm yours.	Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.	1
No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?	1
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.	Never, what?!	0
Pensacola.	That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.	1
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.	Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.	1
I'm looking for...	I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.	0
Zaltar, please help me.	Of course, my dear. What can I do?	1
You're happy for me and Victor.	I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --	1
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?	No. Reba...?	1
You just haven't met the right person.	No. I haven't. Have you?	1
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.	All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.	1
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.	You took the time to pay the saleswoman.	1
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.	Shit.	1
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.	Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.	1
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?	This is different.	1
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?	He filmed his victims.	0
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.	No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.	1
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?	There's a way to get a guy's attention.	1
That vase.	Okay.	0
You think that'll help?	Some buildings I'm working on.	0
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.	Is that really what you want to ask me?	0
Why?	This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.	1
I can't sing it anymore.	Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.	0
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!	"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!	1
Is that your driver?	Goodnight Shelly.	0
It's all right.	It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.	1
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.	Why were you given notice?	1
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.	The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.	1
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.	Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.	1
A secret, I like that.	Wow. I thought I was the only one.	0
Lighten up.	I am lighten. Can we drop this?	1
You need to call your dad.	Voila!	0
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.	No, it's not right.	0
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.	I don't drink coffee...	0
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.	The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...	1
Good samba dancing...?	They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?	0
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?	When can I see, you again ?	0
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.	0
What's this?	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.	1
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.	What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?	1
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge.	1
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!	Poor Cathy --	1
Why not?	Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?	1
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.	0
What's wrong?	I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.	0
There's something wrong with your car, you said.	There sure is.	1
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?	It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.	1
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.	And take the twenty thousand francs ...	1
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.	1
And sweet?	Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.	0
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]	Strange voices, Rose?	0
You figured that all out yourself, huh?	Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeóand hungryóand everything looks black. It's a long movement like thisó  ówith a follow through.	1
I'm afraid you've got to.	Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.	0
Hold on --	That tall, bright building.  Near there.	0
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.	0
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...	Why? People fart backwards.	0
When did you start smoking?	He's an actor, so it can't be good.	0
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.	Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?	0
He hates me.	No--	1
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.	I have this condition -	0
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.	Duck, here they come.	1
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.	Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!	1
I thought you were in a meeting--?	Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.	0
I have one now.	Remember he's left-handed.	0
Who is thin?	Who is this?  It's Tom.	1
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.	Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...	1
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...	I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.	1
This night is too beautiful to have again.	I will be with you, like this. Forever.	1
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.	Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.	0
Be like a weight off your shoulders.	You know we're right.	1
Maybe one of the original crew?	No. It was someone else.	1
He's a riot.	Yes, aren't we all.	0
That's right.	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?	0
Lemme see.	Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.	1
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --	I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --	1
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.	Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.	0
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...	Yes, yes, right.	0
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.	No.  What you do today?	0
Is it that hopeless?	No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...	0
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--	Yes, yes--	1
Huh?	Got another song for us?	1
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, geniusó Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeóand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!	Maude???!	0
Thank you. Having fun?	Now I am.	1
Ted.	Yes.	0
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...	Oh! Great. That's great!	0
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?	Five.	1
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.	Yeah?!	0
Yes.	No, she's with her sister,	0
Any ideas?	Honey - she called me honey.	0
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --	How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?	0
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?	Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?	0
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.	So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!	1
See if you've been making it with my mother.	Sure.	0
Rain.	How'd it happen, Alice?	0
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...	Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?	1
They were jealous of him.	Goodnight to you, Susan.	0
Get off of me! Stop it!	So you're just attracted to me, is that it?	0
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.	All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.	1
ItÌs all right, Ethan..youÌll bring me back...wonÌt you...	I always have, Claire..	1
I can't.	I thought there was something... That night in the club...	1
How?	Did you look for his passport, driving licence?	0
How?  How were we the same people?	Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.	1
I must have frightened her away.	I'm busy.	0
They just wanted to say hello.	That's a nice teapot.	0
How'd they take it back at headquarters?	No.  Doris.	0
So how're you doing?	Why not? It was just money.	0
What's the obvious stuff?	I don't know.	1
No.	You on any medication?	1
A *day*!	Tonight.	1
Me, too.	We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.	1
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.	'Bout what?	1
Shouldn't we care about everybody?	Will you marry me.	0
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.	No.	0
No you didn't.  You took the car.	With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.	0
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...	Yes?	0
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.	There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.	1
What was that?	Nothing.	1
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.	Oh. Gary's loudmouth.	0
Don't I get a kiss?	I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...	1
Don't you like parties?	I sure don't hate you.	0
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.	1
Don't. I know what you're going to say.	No, really, Sara, I don't think you --	1
But this is a porno movie.	No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.	1
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.	Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?	1
Gabe...your arm?	To the foot doctor.	0
When will you be going?	Yeah I'm fine.	0
I want you to come with me.	How do you know that?	1
Thanks. What are you doing?	Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.	1
I sit. I think. I play games.	What kind of games?	1
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?	No.	0
Take the next exit.	What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?	1
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?	No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.	0
No wonder he let her go.	I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.	0
Eliminate the competition.	You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.	1
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.	Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.	1
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --	That's enough, Fran.	1
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?	We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.	1
Who can we trust?	There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.	1
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister	Horror show. What'd you do tonight?	0
So simple to say, so hard to do.	Not when you have no choice.	1
Give it back Nicholas!	Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.	0
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.	Not us!  He's really creepy.	0
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.	At least you were outside.	1
Um-hum ...	Then lunch in the Bois--	1
I got an awful bad cold.	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?	0
Hello.	Keep firing!	0
Hi.	The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.	0
Where?	Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.	0
You don't think I put something in it, do you?	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.	1
You're right!	I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.	0
Why, you need me for the story?	No.  Were you going to you?	1
Do you keep in touch with them?	All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.	1
Need any company?	Stanzi!	0
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?	Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?	0
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.	0
Oui.	One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....	0
You want me to stay?	Yes.	1
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.	Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.	0
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?	1
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.	Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.	1
Well, they are French.	Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.	0
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.	Hang on!	0
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.	Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...	1
Yes?	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.	1
The C.I. what?  God, no...	I'm not going to leave you alone.	0
What do you think?	Are you nuts? Get out of there!	0
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?	Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.	1
Have you heard from Judith's parents?	I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.	0
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.	Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.	1
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.	Are you going to come tonight?	0
All street mimes should be executed.	... Looks like a convention.	1
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.	The what?	0
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.	Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!	0
Come in out of the rain, Bud.	Well...I'm pretty sure I've --	0
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.	Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.	0
Is that right?	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.	1
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?	Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.	1
What's that about?	Forget it.	1
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?	He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.	0
Neither am I.	I knew it--you're seducing me!	0
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.	But why, Claudia?... Why?	0
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.	If the key's on him, how do we get the key?	0
Want some Goobers?	If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.	0
You could have a pool to cool off in.	It's a nice pool, isn't it?	1
Do you have a minute -- ?	Actually I'm running late --	1
He doesn't gamble.	I'll watch.	1
Why not?	Maybe another drink first. More tequila?	0
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.	Don't sweat it.  It's over.	1
To you?	How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?	0
Peter's brother?  But --	Half-brother to be precise.	1
Yeah ...	Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?	0
Tuesday.	......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.	0
Would it work?	Never better. You sleep well.	0
Yes, but why?	Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.	1
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.	It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --	1
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?	Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.	1
Think you can figure it out?	Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.	0
Twenty-two.	That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.	1
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.	You might still have a house.	0
We already did.	What do you mean?	0
Now.	Now?	1
Why not?	Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.	1
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.	What was that?	1
In Terry Canyon?	You--don't know it, do you?	1
Is he going to see this?	These? What are THESE? They're swords.	0
Expect so.	More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.	0
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.	Reynolds? You've done your research.	1
And how's your bill, Senator?	Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.	1
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.	If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...	0
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.	0
Do you love her?	A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!	1
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!	It sure is....	0
What's wrong with that?	Security.	0
What do we do now?	You won't want to watch. Turn around.	1
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.	Happy now?	1
I'd love to see your work.	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?	0
Well we can't just stay here --	I need a skin. Then we leave --	1
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.	I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --	0
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.	Tunnel?	1
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?	No scars.	0
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.	Uh-huh.	0
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.	Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.	1
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.	Look, Mattie, I know you're-	1
We won the championship.	Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?	1
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.	0
What?	Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.	1
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.	What...?	1
No, I--	If you can figure it out, be my guest.	0
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?	If it's at all possible -	0
How'd you feel about it?	I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.	1
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.	I'm glad Bill's back.	1
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...	I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!	0
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.	Is she running a temperature? What is it?	1
How long has he been dead?	Some Italian I picked up back there. Heís in the boot of the Mustang.	0
You did?	Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.	1
What's wrong?	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.	1
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.	Great.	1
Everybody say, "Bye, house."	Bye, house.	1
What do you want? Why are you here?	Nuthin'.	0
Uh-huh.	And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.	1
Next time, page me first.	I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.	0
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!	Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!	1
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.	The bayonet? Did you really?	1
You okay?	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.	1
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.	I'll call you.	1
I don't think that's such a safe idea	My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.	1
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.	You have any children?	0
What are you going to do?	Mm.	0
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?	No. I didn't know that.	1
Really?	It's like she's waiting for something.	1
What was I thinking, right?	I can't protect you anymore.	1
That you've been to Susan?	That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.	0
I thought you dumped her for me.	So let's go. This place creeps me out.	0
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.	I know him.	0
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .	1
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.	I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.	0
But, he could've --	Ok, we'll go for lunch.	0
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.	I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.	1
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.	Love you, too.	1
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.	No.	0
...But I still have the choice...?	Yeah, well he did, didn't he.	0
"InGen."  What's InGen?	Where does it say that?	1
I don't know.	How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --	1
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?	No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.	0
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.	Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.	1
You didn't tell me.	Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.	0
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.	I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.	0
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.	Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.	1
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?	HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?	1
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--	I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.	1
Just ask it!	Is it better?	1
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.	You mean --	0
Yes.	You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.	0
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?	Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.	1
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?	You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.	0
We went about together.	Really?	1
Yes.	Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?	0
So --	Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --	1
All of it?	And not show it to me. Ever again.	1
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.	No. Keep rubbing.	0
Do you think he's here?	Here?	1
We do!	I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.	1
Promise.	Then let's hear them.	0
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?	The mother sure has her hands full.	0
Yes.	out again?	1
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.	Barry Egan.	0
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?	Wish I could say the same.	0
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.	It's orange!	0
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.	Honey, have they offered you the job?	0
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?	Don't be late.	0
-- I'll go see.	I know.	0
Walter, I'm sorry...	You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!	1
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.	I thought it was tremendous.	1
What did he want?	He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.	1
Yeah, but I don't know --	-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?	1
Comrades! Good people of France!	Now, Ninotchka... please!	1
...I can't remember.	That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?	1
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.	No woman would!	0
And now?	Calm down, baby.	0
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.	Forget it.	0
Yes.	So we don't know for sure about you, either.	1
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.	0
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...	Sold in marriage and half way to America.	0
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.	I bet he don't. Karl likes me.	1
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.	Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?	0
Yep.	- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.	0
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.	Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.	1
What's an audience going to tell you?	It's orange!	0
Damn it! You canít fucking walk away from this!	Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.	0
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.	Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.	0
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.	Pardon me?	0
Telling my mother she doesnít have to stay with the kids.	Oh, my God!!	0
A dive? You mean, into the water?	Get a good picture in your mind.	0
Where did you get that?	-- I pose you the same question --	0
What night?	The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!	1
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!	Whose doin' is that?	1
So you're coming tonight, right?	Yes, indeed, yes I am.	1
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	Are you sure it's an opera?	1
No. You?	What's it so hot in here for?	1
Here what comes?	It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --	0
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."	I said that?	1
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?	He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.	1
Something's happened to them.	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.	1
More confident, maybe.	Harder.	1
What just happened?	I don't know.  I lost him.	1
The minute I read that script I said...	I know...	1
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...	How do you know?	1
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.	You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?	0
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar	Why whats wrong with the sugar -	1
You mean that was a...	He'll turn around.	0
I can't believe you're taking his side.	I should leave. You probably need your rest.	0
For what?	My stupid back.	0
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.	No shit.	1
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.	But why, if I'm not hurting you?	1
I wouldn't wait if I were you.	Ah!	0
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.	But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -	1
Every guy has a type!	These are your initials, 'K.C.'?	0
William, you're not making sense.	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'	0
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.	That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?	0
I think that we should stop going out on dates.	You sleeping all right in that house?	0
Daddy!  Come on, a name.	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.	0
And it's too late to shut it down?	I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.	1
Everybody's someone.	Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.	0
No shortage of suspects.	Enough!	0
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Farm...	0
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!	I don't care about the rest of the world!	1
You... .	What I did to Joey.	1
Eduard wanted to marry me.	We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.	0
Ian.  It's guano.	What? Another letter from your friend?	0
Thank you. honey.	Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?	0
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.	No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.	0
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!	My mother's like that.	1
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.	He did?	1
And you are?	We're trapped in this house.	0
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.	J-Jefferson Smith.	0
Marlin Perkins and Jim!	Jim?	1
What if he did?	Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?	1
Are you trying to be funny?	Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!	0
Maybe somebody changed the lock.	Hang in there, man.	0
How's Julie?	Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?	1
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.	Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?	1
I feel different right now.	I'll see what's going on.	0
My mistake - she's glaring.	How long's he been here?	0
She looks terrible, just awful.	Left them at the office.	0
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...	Guess people ought to know who I am...	1
Do you always ask so many questions?	Stop that, Fran.	0
Do you know what you're asking me to do?	I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.	0
I want you to give up that terrible job.	That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.	0
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.	You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.	1
Kinda like men.	Depends how you define 'new'...	0
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.	Life.	0
It doesn't protect your head, though.	Big case?	0
That's a dumb thing to say.	I know, you want go for a ride.	0
Why not?	If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.	1
I don't know.	Hi.	0
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.	Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.	0
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.	Sounds like a bummer.	1
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?	Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.	0
I snuck in.	The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?	0
It seems highly intelligent to me.	I won't hurt you.	0
Sorry.	...and your General?	0
Who told you?	That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!	1
Since grade school.	It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.	0
He was deaf when he wrote this.	Who?	1
I know.	How do you know?	1
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.	Your dissertation? What subject do you study?	1
Get that out of your trunk.	My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?	0
Then you've heard too.	I was there. An eyewitness.	1
I could hide you, Tommy.	What for?	0
She's not his mama either.	I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.	0
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.	Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?	0
We won the championship.	Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.	0
Were you in jail?	Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.	0
Just one daughter.	Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.	1
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.	The truth is...	1
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?	Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.	1
Here it is, right here.	You and me?	0
No argument.	And you told your nephew about it?	0
You want me to move?	Save your breath for the climb.	0
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...	Zeena...	0
Which room is it?	Yeah.	0
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.	Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.	1
Happy days.	Does their hair fall out?	0
You know my name.	You know mine.	1
What, I couldn't hear you?	You went out this morning and bought a gun.	1
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.	Pretty close.	0
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?	Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.	0
What's your name?	J-Jefferson Smith.	1
Drunks are funny--	Yeah. Funny--	1
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.	I didn't ask you to come away with me--	1
The what?	You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.	1
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.	That's impossible.	1
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?	Who?	0
Yo ho ho!	They're...  perfect.  Thank you.	0
Do you care about me?	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.	0
Sleep all right?	-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.	0
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.	Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.	0
Yes, Abbe?	That's what you're supposed to say.	0
That was a long time ago.	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.	1
It's your play.	My mind's lovely.  And yours?	0
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.	Thanks, honey.	0
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!	0
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?	No. Never again.	1
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...	She was taken.	0
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?	I told you not to read all that crap!	0
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.	What do you mean?	0
I love you, too.	Alone.	0
Oh, ha, ha, ha.	Last I heard, his mother was going alone.	0
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.	Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.	0
Walter can I ask you something?	That's ridiculous.	0
Well, sure.	Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.	0
Is there an ashtray in here?	If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.	0
People are expendable to Bodhi.	Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.	0
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --	1
He needed some clothes.	Ohh...	0
Comrade Buljanoff...	Yes, Comrade?	1
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.	Maybe it's time for a vacation.	1
Told you you'd like it.	Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.	0
You pushed me...	What is?	0
I've got to go --	Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.	0
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.	There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.	0
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.	We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.	1
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.	Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.	1
I believe you.	No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...	0
Of course you will.	No, not really.  Throw down a rope.	0
Directing suits you.	Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?	0
Oh, hello.	Mommy, this is Faith.	1
Here?	Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.	0
Yes... You woke me up... Itís the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?	I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.	0
Hi... am I late?	Listen to me. It's hard enough.	0
I'm not interested at all.	Two weeks from tomorrow.	0
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...	<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?	1
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.	Well, nobody has to sell.	1
You still mad at'm?	I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.	0
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?	A car.	0
That's it.	Help me with two minutes of silence!	0
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.	Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!	0
Yeah I guess...sort of.	We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.	0
Hi.	Hello.	1
What's that you carryin'?	Some books Miss Johnson gave me.	1
Right back at the start, right?	Go down in my room.	1
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."	Yeah.	0
Can I get you something?	Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.	1
I thought you might want some hot coffee.	Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .	0
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.	Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.	0
Why not?	Aye.	0
Committed?	And I am...	0
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!	I don't want Caitlin...	1
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !	I would now.	0
Why?	Just...say...no!	1
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.	Where?	0
Can I help you, sir?	I know, I know, I know.	0
He's beautiful.	Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.	1
No.	I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.	0
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-	- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.	1
No. I baked them for you.	No. You baked them for Whitey.	1
Get your clothes off.	I don't know....	0
Okay then...	Good day!	0
That was about a year ago.	It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?	0
Really?	Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.	0
Did you see the tape?	Not yet.	1
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.	What would?	0
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.	That's fine.	0
Oh please.	What?	1
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.	Where's your bike?	1
Not word one.	Can I walk you home?	0
Magic.	What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...	0
This just isn't the best moment for this.	I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.	0
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?	He isn't a man.	0
It means "happiness."	I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.	1
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!	Okay!	1
Where's egghead?	His kid's sick.	1
Good morning.	Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!	1
Pull out, goddamnit!	Take it up.	0
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?	Would you?	1
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.	A business meeting, I told you that.	0
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...	0
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.	I'll think about Wednesday.	0
You live in Manhattan?	We were supposed to be together.	0
Well, I --	Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?	1
I don't see the point in that.	It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.	0
No, Marty, please...	Very good. Back in a jiff.	0
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?	What!	0
What about you?	What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.	1
Do you think about the game?	Yes.	1
Anything wrong?	No, no.	1
Are you all right, Doctor?	Where am I?	1
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.	You expect me to believe that?	1
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..	No... Sharp -- You look great.	0
My therapist said that --	He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.	0
Come one Will. I just want to know.	I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.	1
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?	It's not you - it's the dress!	0
In German?	Y'mean take off our costumes?	0
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?	Oh yes?	0
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.	Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.	1
Oh, no.	It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.	1
Someone stole Sid's file?	And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.	0
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.	Let's drop back an' boot up.	0
Santos... It isn't.	Have it your way... But you want it.	1
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.	Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.	0
Excuse me?	How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.	1
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.	How do you do, Mr. Leland?	1
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--	I will.	0
It was a wonderful day.	You still haven't answered my question.	1
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?	Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.	1
Five-- Six--	That was great!	0
Who is she Daddy?	Okay.	0
Thinks he is. Well, he is.	He is?	1
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.	How grateful?	1
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!	I bet you do!	1
I think that we should stop going out on dates.	I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.	1
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.	What does she do?	1
This is a sexy case.	Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.	1
You're avoiding the question.	There's nothing to explain	0
And how would you know that?	Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.	1
Let me get you a cup?	Only if you can spare it.	1
Och, you do, Fergie.	Of course. I forgot.	1
That!?!	What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?	1
I know you do, Sidney.	Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...	1
What happened?	I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.	0
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.	Not now. We need air, not greetings!	0
Admiration?  My my.	Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.	0
The tall trees...	Look, you donít understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...	0
The park!	It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!	1
About the Ottos?	The ear is from a missing person maybe?	0
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.	Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.	1
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.	That's a lot of people all at once.	0
No.	Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!	0
All right.	It'll just be a few days.	0
You're not taking me seriously.	Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.	1
Did you warn her?	No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.	1
How is she?	Fine.	1
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...	You were right.  I'm not being set up.	0
Why, haven't youó?	Are you that sure of tomorrow?	0
You want me to leave?	Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...	0
So? How'd it go last night?	With who?	1
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-	Dead Poets honor.	1
I think I can make it to South Boston.	Aah, it's kind of a hike.	1
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.	You got a better idea?	0
Nah.	Do you know where she would be?	1
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?	You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.	1
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?	What?	0
I know her by the Back.	...these guy'll back you up.	1
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?	Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'	1
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?	That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.	1
You said that the last time.	Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?	1
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?	Alfredo died. Do you remember him?	1
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...	Yes you do.	0
What are you talking about?	I don't know.	1
Better times.	Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.	0
I canít believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnít want to raise the kids here?	No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.	1
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."	Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.	0
Get your clothes off.	What are you talking about? I'm freezing.	1
You dance...	Divinely?	1
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?	No trouble.	0
You do.	No, I don't.	1
No!  Why would I want to kill him?	Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.	1
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.	Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?	1
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...	I thought you might have.	0
My husband tells me you're in sharks.	I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.	1
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!	You're sure it was the Hilton?	0
No. The little one.	Is Mary... in trouble?	0
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?	I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.	0
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?	You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.	0
With what?	Honey.	0
Take your time, Jer.	Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...	0
What's it mean?	And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....	1
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.	Yes.  I can even read star maps.	0
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!	So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.	1
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.	Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?	0
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?	I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.	0
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.	Have I?  I'm trying all the time.	0
Why?	Darling, darling... please!	0
No! At least I don't think I am!	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?	1
I'd given you up.	From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.	0
He looks familiar.	That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.	1
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.	1
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.	Hmm?	1
What are you on about?	The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.	1
What?	-- Tuscarora --	0
I promise, Jack...	Promise me again...	1
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?	I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.	1
You were little Jesse James when you left.	But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.	0
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!	No.	0
You didn't think much about that before.	Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.	1
What did you do with your dog?	She's still a virgin.	0
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.	That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.	1
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.	Come on!	0
Strange man...	Wait, what happened to the tree?	0
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...	I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.	1
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --	1
He doesn't have a temperature.	Studied acting, I assume?	0
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.	He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?	0
It used to make me laugh, but.	No.	0
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?	Tell me about its sexual roots.	0
That's not really a very proper question.	How old are you?	1
You're getting off the grift?	That's right.	1
It's not -- what's a 422?	It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --	1
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.	We'd love to hear it.	1
Something bad happened here, Murphy.	That much I think we've already established.	1
Oh ... Hi.	I won't, Mom.	0
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?	Why?	0
You would?	That's right.  Will you marry me?	0
Do you have a cigarette?	Why?	0
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.	Too aggressive?	0
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?	No.	1
Yes, you do.	I quit.	1
I'm not making any promises.	We'll turn back anytime you want.	1
How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.	1
I'm coming with you.	There's no point both of us getting wet.	1
One minute but then--	--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?	1
I don't know.	But you might.	1
Dad.	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?	1
It's just me.	Jezzie?	1
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.	How like her.	1
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.	What plans?	1
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.	Barbara --	1
Maybe.	Yes.	0
Sartorius wants to destroy it.	Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.	1
Is it this aisle or the next one over?	This one.	1
What happened?	Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.	1
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.	I don't think it's negative five.	0
Think you can figure it out?	I'll think of something.	1
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...	In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.	1
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.	We never even had a conversation, Norman.	0
How long before this car's hot?	Pull over.	1
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.	I'd sure like to know who.	1
I thought Blockbuster fired you.	He is?	0
You are a virgin!	I didn't say that.	1
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?	Sure. We can practice talking.	1
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.	Yes, Madame.	1
Ooh! Can we?!	...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.	0
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.	Gear. You know, clothing.	0
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.	Don't say that.	1
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's	You're his sister, right?	0
Yeah, I know.	We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.	0
What is it, Harold?	They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.	1
Feeding my fish.	Is that the fish you won at the carnival?	1
I understand you perfectly.	Have you got it now?	1
Is that what you want?	Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.	0
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.	You're saying you willed these events to happen?	0
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.	1
I'm at sea, Jason.	I think America suits you.	0
Look at all that silverware.	I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.	0
Thank you.	They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.	1
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.	You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.	0
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...	I love those doors.	1
My God... what has happened?	I thought these people were broke.	0
Yeah.	You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.	1
Alright, now tell me. What is it?	Why Edie, Ió	0
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?	He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.	1
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?	I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.	0
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...	You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.	0
No, it was so right it scares me.	I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.	1
Two miles.	If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?	0
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.	But <u>we</u> let him out.	1
I hope they fucking fry us all.	Yeah. French fries...	1
Jesus...	What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?	0
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.	How much time does he have left?	1
You're talking like a drunk.	Yeah.	0
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.	I wouldn't go so far as to say that.	1
Promise?	No honey.	0
She was a liar, she was a liar!	Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.	0
Perhaps it wasnít so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.	I'd taken the Mask?	0
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.	Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?	1
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.	You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!	0
I'll see you there.	I'll see you there.	1
Mine.	Carrots.	0
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.	Yes, but you, you do care about me.	1
No, not at all.	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.	1
Where is she?	Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.	0
Oh, maaaaan?!	What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"	1
"Be there?"	People now have dignity when frying eggs?	0
The ones you built?	What's that, Dolores?	0
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?	Where, then?	0
Somebody robbed the Vatican.	Oh.  No.	1
I think this place is just fine.	Orderly.	0
I don't care, Dad. I love you.	I love you too, Francie.	1
But still died.	But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?	0
"In Washington..."	A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!	0
DON'T!!!	Uh oh...	1
Yes.	What do you want me to say?	0
Do you know what he's been saying to her?	He's an actor, so it can't be good.	1
What?	Okay, don't stop.	0
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.	You're upset, that's alright.	1
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.	To warn her about Chino.	0
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.	Let's get a hot dog.	1
You're a shit.	No, really, five thousand with your discount.	1
Paul, I know you've been out.	What?	1
How'd you feel about it?	You did.  Well... thank you.	0
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...	No...	1
Will you give this to him.	If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.	1
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.	Silicon Valley?	1
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.	You didn't become crazy.	0
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.	Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.	1
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.	I told you I didn't want to mix in it.	1
There you go with those moves again.	Too aggressive?	1
WHAT?	Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.	0
- right..where is it?	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.	0
We're only talking about six weeks.	Will you be here?	1
Like what?	You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?	0
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?	Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.	0
Like you?	Where? Why?	0
What?	The last I looked, we were just talking things over.	1
-- do you wanna cup?	That's great, thank you.	1
He's okay. They sobered him up.	Did he say what they're asking him about?	1
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.	David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.	0
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.	Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?	0
Who's Strickland?	Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.	1
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?	Yeah.	1
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.	What did... what did I want to be?	1
Why not?	I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.	0
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-	No, so help me.	1
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.	I love the fragrance of chilidogs.	1
In what way?	Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!	1
Okay.  Talk.	I just wanted to... I, uh...	1
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?	I have no idea.	1
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?	He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.	1
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?	0
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.	Yeah. You want a beer?	0
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.	I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.	1
You're really leaving, huh?	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?	1
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?	I don't remember.    I was drunk.	1
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?	So noted.	0
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.	Where would they be going?	1
The Feds?!	FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.	1
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...	Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?	1
Don't leave me.	Those guys bother you?	1
You ratted on my mother??	I've been thinking--	0
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...	Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!	0
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.	0
She is kicking you out.	Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.	1
I will not calm down!	He was delightful.	0
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.	They know what--this fella looks like?	1
I found this.	I told you. We met yesterday.	0
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?	I wasn't going to say --	0
I think I'd better go home now please.	It's a pretty piece of land.	0
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?	Shall we tell her?	1
He sent me the cutest e-mail.	I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...	1
For what?	For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?	1
The things that go on.	How do you like that one?	1
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.	Yah...	0
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.	I like the President. He is a very nice man.	1
Your face is familiar.	Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -	1
Folks come. Folks go.	Here, let me carry that.	1
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...	The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...	1
Could you?	Well, anyway... Sorry.	0
I have to talk to you.	Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...	0
What were you doing up so late?	Hunhh? Nothing.	1
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!	Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.	1
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?	Hmmm?	0
What a nose.  You missed your calling.	Can I open it?	1
You know carpentry?	I won't be late.	0
I'm making you a steak.	How soon?	0
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?	Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -	0
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.	I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.	0
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.	Your husband?	0
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.	I am Joe.	1
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?	With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.	1
What are you doing??	That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.	1
Why?	That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!	0
And Danny Zorn, what was that?	Had to be done.	1
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?	Hopefully sooner than later.	1
Sorry.	Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.	1
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	Yes.	0
She's flying starships !	Who ?	1
Hi!	Uh-huh.	0
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.	In a dress.	1
So, why did you bring this along?	I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!	1
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	Thank you.	0
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?	Nah, I don't know.	1
It's nice here. It's different.	Out!  Out!	0
Yes, darling,	I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.	0
Sure did.	Everything went to his head.	1
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?	No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.	0
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.	Just smile.	0
I told you. I'm like positive.	All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.	0
What's wrong?	Yes. I said this is too good to live...	0
Don't you want me to?	Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.	0
Then call me tomorrow.	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.	0
Why?	Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..	1
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -	I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.	0
A Fender Strat. You bought this?	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.	1
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.	You dream about dead guys?	1
What?	No, your kids.	0
That's not what I heard.	It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!	0
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.	You seem pretty sure of that.	1
It doesn't have much to do with science.	What then?	1
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.	Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?	1
No....	Off....	1
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.	I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.	0
...And he called the reporters --	Yeah... Threw my whole day off.	1
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...	The Hostages...?	1
Is that all?	Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.	1
You hate to swim.	Yes.  I'm tired.	0
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...	As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.	1
Keep your mind off her.	She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.	1
Like old times. Same booth, same song --	There is no such regulation.	0
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?	Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.	0
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?	I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.	0
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.	Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?	0
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.	1
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.	Hey... hey.  Don't do that.	0
Yes?	Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.	1
We do not go into your courts.	People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.	1
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...	0
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.	No, thanks.	0
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!	Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.	0
I never like to talk about my work.	You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --	0
They've got a book for this?	Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.	0
That movie makes me feel guilty.	It's an American spacecraft.	0
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?	1
Do I look as funny as you do?	Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.	0
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.	I'll be scarred for life.	0
Let's get a coffee.	All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?	0
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.	No.	0
Are you with the tournament?	Who's that with your Dad?	0
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.	This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?	1
Do you mean that?	I mean it.	1
Bravo.	Odd desire for anyone.	0
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?	Yes.	0
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?	If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerówe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.	1
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--	That's what your man is supposed to do.	0
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.	Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.	1
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.	I liked him.	1
Oh.  What do you think about?	Bodybuilding!	0
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.	Wrap it around that rock twice.	1
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!	You get off on abuse or something?	0
I don't thinkI can.	Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...	0
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...	I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.	1
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.	That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.	0
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...	It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.	0
Yes, I know.	I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.	1
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!	0
You couldn't have made that jump.	I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.	1
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...	Never, what?!	0
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.	No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.	1
It'll only take a second.	Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.	0
It's over, Jake. It's all over.	You up for that?	0
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.	Get some sugar too, for the coffee.	1
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.	0
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.	Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?	1
What?	Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.	1
I don't know.	Have you looked inside?	1
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.	Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.	0
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.	So did I.	0
Do I love you?	Those guys bother you?	0
Hi.  I was worried I was early.	In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.	0
Well?	God, you're beautiful.	1
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?	Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.	0
Don't force it, you'll break it.	"Intra-Agency fraternizing."	0
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.	1
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?	That's what I was gonna ask you.	0
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.	0
You sure?	No, I got time.	1
Now, why in the world would he do that?	I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.	1
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?	In your opinion.	0
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?	Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.	1
I have no secrets from my family.	Loretta, I can't marry you.	1
Don't do anything silly.	Thanks for the vote of confidence.	1
That's your decision.	Look at me. I'm ice cold.	1
I'm being a pain, huh?	... Not at all.	1
What is it, a surprise?	It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.	0
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.	You called me Jeffrey.	0
It's alright.	Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.	1
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..	Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?	1
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?	Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.	0
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?	Does he love you?	0
The next corner we can get a cab.	Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?	0
It's delicious, trust me.	Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --	0
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?	No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.	0
Huh?	Forget it.	1
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.	Marylin? When did I say...?	1
Which way?	Both.	1
I think so.	I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...	0
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?	You're sometimes not sure?	0
I got it done.	She's dead.	0
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.	How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?	0
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!	I don't know! I just did!	0
I don't know... what are you looking up?	We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'	1
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?	You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.	0
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.	Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?	1
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.	...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.	0
You're crazy --	That's all we need.	0
Other than me.	Why not?	0
Oh now, don't be silly.	Why?	0
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...	Nothing like a little liveliness.	0
Want a Metrix?	What's a Metrix?	1
Yes.	You said that two weeks ago.	0
No, on the porch.	Oh yeah, and then what?	1
I don't want to go there.	Easy for you to say.	0
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.	Isn't that how it is for everybody?	0
He was gentlemanly. I like that.	It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.	0
Yes.	That's a good one.	0
About what?	"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."	0
Go on.	Name one.	0
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.	It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.	0
Contacts.	Love a cup of tea. With lemon.	0
Why not?	Bates.	1
You're a comedian?	Yeah. And an actor.	1
What do you mean?	Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.	0
Frances?	My fiancÈe.	1
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?	I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.	0
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.	Come on!	0
What?	What?	0
Shit! The house is on fire!	"And your children all gone."	1
My daddy likes me home before dark.	Yep.	0
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--	I'm just having my last few drinks.	0
Hey?	Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.	1
No.	There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!	0
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?	There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...	1
Hell...	We don't get to talk much any more.	0
No. I'll do them later.	Francesca?	1
Then who did?	No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.	1
Yes. Could you give me some information?	Gladly.	1
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?	Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.	0
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.	And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.	0
Got any good ideas?	No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.	0
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.	But really, you never know.	0
No.	Yes.	1
I'll wait for your call.	No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?	0
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...	Hey...hey...it's okay!	1
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.	What's that, peanut?	1
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--	Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.	1
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...	This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.	0
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --	I thought you hardly know her.	1
Peggy Lee?	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?	0
I love you, John.  I always have.	I know, Mom.  I know.	1
What for? Who are you?	Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?	0
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.	You like baseball?	1
S'matter?	Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.	1
Your phone number?	In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.	1
I am?	Who were you talking to?	1
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?	I don't want to talk about this here.	0
What's that?	"Ein hurigan" - I guess.	1
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?	It's more involved than that.	0
You ready to eat?	I'll wait till after the children.	1
I can't move!	I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.	0
Something like that.	Something like that?	1
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.	I gotta take some money out, that's what for.	0
Yeah, the time went by so fast.	It did.	1
He's not Army, it's not official --	You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.	0
Honey!	She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.	1
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.	What?	0
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?	Is that what you want?	1
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.	No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.	1
I meanÖYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can	And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?	0
That's my line!	Who we gonna beat?	0
I refuse to resign!	Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.	1
Sure.  Ten cents.	No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --	0
Yeah?	Ma'am.	0
Of course.	Yeah, bu-bu-but why?	1
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.	I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.	1
Nothing yet.	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!	0
Yes?	She gone like they say?	1
Got any requests?	She's adorable. But I had to end it.	0
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!	Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.	1
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.	Or, 'civilized'.	1
I don't think you're a bum.	Absolutely positively.	0
What're you doing?	I like your attitude. But it can be risky.	0
Some discussion.	I just saw a man walk out of your room!	1
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?	I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.	1
What -- am I --	They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.	0
....Hi.....	....Hi.....	1
The kind with an umbrella in it....	Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.	0
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.	Maybe I will.	1
Usually on the right side as you go in.	Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.	1
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?	Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.	0
Lenny, this shit's illegal.	Define illegal.	1
You don't believe that.	Hardly ever.	1
I guess so.	What do you think?	1
What an adorable hat.	They think I have a concussion.	1
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?	We can't stay here.	1
Fired?	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.	0
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?	Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.	1
After we eat, Dad.	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.	0
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.	'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'	0
Yes you can.	Wounded? How?	0
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.	Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.	0
Dad.  Do you believe me?	See, I wouldn't think that about you.	0
You don't have to do that.	Get your clothes on, move your butt.	0
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.	Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --	0
Did you sleep with her?	It's getting dark. Go home.	0
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.	I found it on the seat.	0
You got any money?	Thought you had a man for that.	1
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?	Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.	1
Apollo?	Go you Huskies...	0
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.	Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.	1
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.	Then why isn't there anyone around?	0
But then I had a brother and a sister left.	So had I.	1
I like to laugh, Fred.	That's why I married you.	1
What do you do - for a living I mean?	Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?	0
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?	I'm living here while I build another house.	1
Michael, are you still in bed?	No.  I'm up.	1
I order you to find out where we are!	Wait, wait.  You told her about me?	0
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.	Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.	1
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.	Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...	1
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?	Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.	1
Who?	They asked me to help.	0
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.	My turn. What's your favorite song?	1
Who are you?	I'm wit' Carlos.	1
Don't you want to know my name?	I already know it, Mary.	1
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.	Annie, what's the matter?	1
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.	You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?	0
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?	Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.	1
You don't think he's dead, do you?	He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.	1
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?	Always. Always.	1
-- did she talk to you?	She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.	1
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.	It's the only way it makes sense.	0
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.	Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.	1
This isn't for real.	You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.	1
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.	I see.	1
...no... Mac... p-please...	He did? When?	0
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?	Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.	1
I think itís good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Itís very human.	Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.	0
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.	What is this, Emmi?	1
Did someone say I wasn't nice?	Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?	0
Pittsburgh.	I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.	1
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.	You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.	1
There's nothing to tell.	Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?	1
No.  You were talking about chess.	You're serious?	0
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...	Brilliant.	0
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.	Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.	0
Why were you sitting here, instead of...	I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.	1
You've got everything?	Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.	0
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?	...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...	1
Money!	Yes, of course, -- money!	1
